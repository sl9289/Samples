    "This code aims to scrape the latest information for all News, Tweets and summary page from Altmetric. The specific steps include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) News: Since the raw data \"Altmetric_News.xlsx\" only includes the news with valid links, in order to get all the news regardless of whether their links are valid or not, this code will first scrape all headlines, sources and subtitles of news without links (dataframe is called: df1). Then, I merge \"df1\" with the raw data set to match all news with their links (for the news that have invalid links, I will match them with \"NA\"), and export \"News_all_links.xlsx\". Besides, this code will scrape the entire news contents from top5 media sources for further research purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Twitter: Get the account handles (under a column called medialink) and headlines of all tweets, and delete our Twitter posts. Since tweets are always without any subtitles, I don't add this column here. Then, put the medialinks and headlines into a new dataframe \"df\", and add other columns 'altmetric', '#article', 'author', 'mediatype', 'mediasource‘.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Fetch the Altmetric scores, citations, readers and demographic information, and add them into \"df\" according to existing paper links. Then, this code exports this dataset as \"Altmetric_tweet+sum.xlsx\".\n",
    "\n",
    "After the above processing, this code will export two new data sets \"Altmetric_tweet+sum.xlsx\" and \"News_all_links.xlsx\", which will also locate in a folder of google drive."

      "By Lisa Rapaport\n",
      "(Reuters Health) - Older women who eat lots of sweets and processed grains may be more likely to suffer from insomnia than their counterparts whose don't consume much of these foods, a U.S. study suggests.\n",
      "Researchers examined data from food diaries for more than 50,000 women in their mid-60s who had already gone through menopause, a transition that is also associated with an increased risk of sleep problems and insomnia. They focused on the \"dietary glycemic index,\" a measure of how many foods people consume that can contribute to spikes in blood sugar levels.\n",
      "Women with the highest dietary glycemic index scores - meaning they consumed more refined carbohydrates like white bread, sweets and sugary soda - were 11% more likely than women with the lowest scores to report insomnia at the start of the study period.\n",
      "They were also 16% more likely to develop new insomnia during the three-year follow-up period.\n",
      "\"Our results point to the importance of diet for those who suffer from insomnia,\" said lead study author James Gangwisch of the Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York City.\n",
      "\"Avoiding insomnia is therefore another good reason to avoid sweets besides weight control,\" Gangwisch said by email.\n",
      "While the study wasn't designed to prove whether or how eating too many sweets and refined carbs might cause insomnia, it's possible that hormonal changes may play a role.\n",
      "\"When blood sugar is raised quickly, your body reacts by releasing insulin, and the resulting drop in blood sugar can lead to the release of hormones such as adrenaline and cortisol, which can interfere with sleep,\" Gangwisch said.\n",
      "Insomnia disproportionately affects women, the study team notes in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.\n",
      "In the study, women whose diet included higher amounts of vegetables, fiber and whole fruit (not juice) were less likely to have or develop problems with insomnia. Even though whole fruits contain sugar, they also contain fiber that helps minimize spikes in blood sugar, making these foods lower on the dietary glycemic index.\n",
      "One limitation of the study is that researchers didn't objectively measure food intake, the quantity or quality of sleep, or any shifts in blood sugar or hormones.\n",
      "It's also possible that chronic insomnia contributed to cravings for carbs or sweets, rather than women developing insomnia as a result of eating too much sugar and refined grains, Jose Ordovas, director of Nutrition and Genomics at the Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts University in Boston, pointed out.\n",
      "\"Using these findings as the basis for prevention and treatment of insomnia is extremely premature,\" Ordovas, who wasn't involved in the study, said by email.\n",
      "Doctors often recommend a low-glycemic diet to people who need to lower or control their blood sugar, including individuals with diabetes, or who need to lose weight or develop healthier eating habits.\n",
      "Better sleep could be yet another reason to eat this way, Gangwisch said.\n",
      "\"The take-home message here is to limit the consumption of highly processed carbohydrates such as added sugars since they could contribute toward or exacerbate insomnia,\" Gangwisch said.\n",

      "Scientists from Columbia University in New York looked at the food diaries of more than 50,000 women.\n",
      "READ MORE: The best sleep aids to help you nod off\n",
      "They found those whose diets had a higher glycemic index (GI) were more likely to struggle to nod off.\n",
      "GI is a measure of how carbohydrate-rich foods raise blood glucose levels. High GI produce - like white bread, pasta or rice - cause sugar spikes.\n",
      "“When blood sugar is raised quickly, your body reacts by releasing insulin, and the resulting drop in blood sugar can lead to the release of hormones such as adrenaline and cortisol, which can interfere with sleep,” study author Dr James Gangwisch said.\n",
      "Insomnia affects a third of people in the UK, Bupa statistics show.\n",
      "In the US, 30% of adults struggle to nod off, with 10% battling chronic insomnia, according to the American Sleep Association.\n",
      "Medical conditions like asthma, back pain and depression can be to blame, as well as shift work, napping and certain medications, the National Sleep Foundation reports.\n",
      "When it comes to our diet, alcohol, caffeine and heavy meals are all recognised triggers.\n",
      "READ MORE: Doctors say this is what happens when teens don’t get enough sleep\n",
      "Studies have suggested refined carbohydrates may cause insomnia, however, results were mixed.\n",
      "With most trials being short lived, it was unclear if refined carbs triggered the condition or those who struggled to nod off ate more sugary foods to “get them through the day”.\n",

      "The cabbage soup diet is considered a fad diet that's not sustainable or effective, and no prominent doctors or medical institutions promote it.\n",
      "Because liquids can lead to fullness, as can fiber-filled cabbage, the concept behind the diet is to minimize hunger and cravings.\n",
      "Although cabbage is a healthy diet component, the plan calls for such an intense caloric deficit that it may lead to weakness, muscle loss, and water-weight loss, which is easily regained.\n",
      "Visit Insider's Health Reference library for more advice.\n",
      "The cabbage soup diet is designed for rapid weight-loss and is considered one of the oldest fad diets, originating in the 1950s. The plan allows for unlimited consumption of cabbage soup with small amounts of other foods included in a strict schedule.\n",
      "In the 1980s, this diet was touted as the Dolly Parton Diet, the Trans World Airlines Stewardess Diet, and the Model's Diet. It typically cycles through every 10 years or so with a new name.\n",
      "There is no science backing the effectiveness of the cabbage soup diet, and no prominent doctors or medical institutions promote it. However, some elements of the diet can be appropriated in healthier ways - like consumption of more filling, vegetable-based soups - says Laura Zeratsky, registered dietician and nutritionist for the Mayo Clinic.\n",
      "\"It falls under being a fad diet for the fact that it is not considered sustainable,\" Zeratsky says. \"Any diet that has a purpose to produce rapid weight loss is a concern.\"\n",
      "Here are more details about the cabbage soup diet, along with its pros and cons.\n",
      "The meal plan for the cabbage soup diet is as follows:\n",
      "Day 1: Cabbage soup and raw fruit (but no bananas)\n",
      "Day 2: Cabbage soup and raw or cooked vegetables but not potatoes\n",
      "Day 3: Cabbage soup and raw fruit and vegetables, but no bananas or potatoes\n",
      "Day 4: Cabbage soup, skim milk, and as many as eight bananas\n",
      "Day 5: Cabbage soup, six tomatoes, and 20 ounces of chicken or beef\n",
      "Day 6: Cabbage soup, unlimited beef, and unlimited vegetables (excluding potatoes)\n",
      "Day 7: Cabbage soup, brown rice, and sugar-free fruit juice\n",
      "The soup is meant to serve as a filling, low-calorie primary food source, Zeratsky says. Because liquids can lead to fullness, as can fiber-filled cabbage, the idea is to minimize hunger and cravings. Between the fiber and the fluid, this typically limits the appetite, making it easier to adhere to a strict calorie deficit.  The diet provides fewer than 1,000 calories a day on days one through three, about 1,000 or slightly more on days four and seven, and more than 1,200 calories on days five and six. That is well below the recommended range of 1,600 to 2,400.\n",
      "Several variations on the soup recipe have been published, but most include cabbage, onions, tomatoes or tomato juice, celery, and carrots.\n",
      "As with most weight-loss plans, there are both healthy elements and drawbacks. The cabbage soup diet is no exception.\n",
      "Pros:\n",
      "Cabbage is in the cruciferous vegetable family and contains vitamins E and C, which are antioxidants that protect cells from damage. These vegetables have been found to protect against breast and colorectal cancer and reduce tumor growth.\n",
      "Cabbage also has a high fiber content, which is good for weight loss because it keeps you feeling full.\n",
      "Due to the dietary fiber in the soup, it could help lower cholesterol and help constipation.\n",
      "The soup is relatively inexpensive given the low price of cabbage and the few ingredients needed.\n",
      "Cons:\n",
      "Cabbage commonly causes bloating and flatulence because of its high fiber content. It also contains raffinose, a complex sugar that is hard to digest. Both of these can make you feel very uncomfortable.\n",
      "The diet is strict, allowing only relatively bland foods. According to the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, diets this strict should be avoided because critical nutrients are missing.\n",
      "The diet may cause weakness and fatigue due to low-calorie and low protein intake.\n",
      "The diet may lead to muscle loss because it is a rapid weight-loss program, which may lead to loss of water weight and muscle atrophy. Most of the weight lost on this diet is water weight and will likely be regained once a dieter resumes their normal food intake.\n",
      "Depending on the recipe or a dieter's taste preference, this cabbage soup may contain high amounts of sodium, making it risky for people with hypertension and kidney disease.\n",
      "The weight loss linked to such low-calorie diets is usually not sustainable.\n",
      "Like many other short-term, low-calorie diet plans, the cabbage soup diet is not recommended by medical experts.\n",
      "Although cabbage is a healthy diet component, the plan calls for such an intense caloric deficit that it could lead to weakness and muscle loss.\n",
      "\"It's nothing I would recommend, but there are points of it someone could use within an otherwise balanced diet,\" Zeratsky says. \"Including a low-sodium [kind of] vegetable soup could be a step in the right direction in terms of feeling full.\"\n",

      "New research published in the journal Science suggests that a compound naturally found in cruciferous vegetables may inhibit cancerous cell growth in the body. Broccoli, kale, cauliflower, and Brussels sprouts are examples of some of the nutrient-dense vegetables that contain the compound, which is called indole-3-carbinol, also known as \"I3C.\" Researchers were able to successfully control another cancer-causing gene known as WWP1 using the compound in a study that involved both mice and humans.\n",
      "The Harvard Medical School team behind the research set out in the hopes of reactivating a gene in the body called \"PTEN,\" which helps the body stop tumor growth—the gene often deactivates in those who are diagnosed with most forms of cancer. But when analyzing cells in their subjects, they discovered that WWP1 stops the other gene, PTEN, from preventing cancerous growth. Later, researchers identified the compound found in broccoli and other veggies as a remedy to prevent PTEN from being deactivated; administering the compound to animals in particular, they illustrated that tumor growth dramatically slowed afterwards.\n",
      "It's no secret that vegetables are some of the best foods to incorporate into your diet, and the holistic benefits of eating more vegetables can be life changing. But in the study's release, lead author Pier Paolo Pandolfi, MD, Ph.D., says that you'd have to eat upwards of six pounds of raw cruciferous vegetables everyday to absorb enough of the compound to fight cancerous cells. The team is working on a solution where those affected by cancer wouldn't have to eat so many vegetables to reap the benefit. \"These findings pave the way toward a long-sought tumor suppressor reactivation approach to cancer treatment,\" Pandolfi, the director of the cancer research institute at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, told ScienceDaily.\n",
      "Researchers are now working on a solution that can provide the benefits of this vegetable compound to anyone hoping to slow cancerous growths. This research adds another layer of evidence that suggests vegetables are powerhouse staples for any diet; there are plenty of innovative ways to incorporate broccoli into healthy weeknight dinners—not to mention cauliflower and Brussels sprouts, as well as cabbage, kale, and all the other delicious vegetables that fall under the cruciferous umbrella.\n",

      "Pandemics have consequences beyond the death and disease directly caused by the novel pathogen. In the 1918 influenza pandemic, more deaths were caused by the pneumococcal bacterium among those made susceptible to bacterial infection by influenza than by the flu itself.\n",
      "One potential byproduct of the devastating COVID-19 pandemic is the threat of an old scourge: measles. In the United States, two doses of measles vaccines are recommended for all children. These doses are usually administered as the measles, mumps and rubella combined vaccine. The first dose is given at 12 to 15 months of age, and the second dose at 4 to 6 years of age. Schools in all states require measles vaccination for entry, though they allow various medical or nonmedical exemptions.\n",
      "But early in the pandemic, there were substantial disruptions to routine non-COVID vaccination — including fewer children coming to vaccination appointments, and fewer students enrolling in kindergarten, meaning they skipped the requisite vaccines. Many children who missed their recommended doses still haven’t received them.\n",
      "The World Health Organization has already warned this year of a “perfect storm” for measles outbreaks worldwide and recorded nearly twice as many global cases in the first two months of 2022 than in 2021.\n",
      "In one of the country’s most significant public health achievements, the U.S. eliminated measles cases originating within its borders in 2000, thanks to vaccines. Since then, measles has reached the U.S. mainly via Americans returning from abroad, or in secondary outbreaks associated with these importations from other countries.\n",
      "Yet this public health victory now faces a twofold threat: missed vaccine doses in 2020 and 2021, and growing anti-vaccine views because of opposition to the COVID-19 shots.\n",
      "Herd immunity against measles was under threat even before the pandemic. Increasing vaccine refusal over the last two decades has created a population of unvaccinated individuals from toddlers to young adults.\n",
      "Looking at outbreak investigations, my colleagues and I found that from 2000 through 2015 a large majority of measles cases started in people who were unvaccinated despite being vaccine-eligible. More than 70% of these had nonmedical exemptions, i.e. exemptions for religious or philosophical reasons.\n",
      "In another 2016 study, my colleagues and I estimated that 12.5% of U.S. children and teens were susceptible to measles — accounting for those who had refused or missed vaccine doses, as well as those who were too young to be vaccinated but were not protected through maternal antibodies. Alarmingly, among children 3 years old or younger, about a quarter did not have measles immunity. Since measles is highly infectious and requires very high levels of population immunity to prevent outbreaks, the U.S. was at high risk.\n",
      "In fact, in the years before the COVID-19 pandemic, large measles outbreaks brought the United States close to revocation of its measles elimination status by the World Health Organization. If COVID vaccine misinformation and opposition ramp up vaccine mistrust in general, as health experts fear, measles vaccination rates in the U.S. could dip below 90% — the approximate childhood rate as of 2019 — and enter the danger zone.\n",
      "In the U.S. before a measles vaccine became available, the disease was associated with a substantial number of hospitalizations and deaths. Even in the post-elimination era, hospitalizations and need for outbreak control can be costly. A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention review of measles outbreaks between 2001 and 2018 found that the median cost per case was $32,805.\n",
      "And measles infection can depress the immune system for years, hampering the body’s ability to respond to other infections, as was found in a 2019 study that aligned with decades of clinical and epidemiological observations.\n",
      "The risk of large measles outbreaks is increasing with most COVID mandates ended and international travel resuming largely without enforced restrictions. Public health authorities will be gambling if they do not preempt and prepare for these outbreaks. Past public health emergencies demonstrate the considerable threat: During the 2014-16 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, disruptions in routine vaccination resulted in more children dying of measles than the Ebola virus in some countries.\n",
      "But there are straightforward ways for federal, state and local authorities to mitigate the risk right now.\n",
      "Childhood immunization mandates continue to play an important role, but because they are imposed at school entry, they do not cover the younger age groups at highest risk of measles infection and its complications. Just ensuring that the shots reach a high number of the children who become eligible for vaccination this year is not sufficient — those who missed measles doses in the last couple of years should be vaccinated as well.\n",
      "There needs to be a national “catch-up” campaign to vaccinate those who missed their doses of routine vaccines during the pandemic, with a particular focus on kids younger than 5 (school age). Since mid-2020, many countries have planned catch-up campaigns to reduce the risk of measles and other childhood diseases.\n",
      "Research indicates that doctors and nurses remain the most trusted source of vaccine information even among the vaccine-hesitant. Any national measles catch-up campaign — led by the CDC in collaboration with state and local health departments — must prioritize healthcare providers’ voices and patient interactions for strong public health communication, especially since anti-vaccine misinformation is a growing problem.\n",
      "The COVID-19 pandemic has already taken a heavy toll on children. We can prevent further damage by stopping the return of an already vanquished foe.\n",

      "According to new research, the measles virus deletes part of the immune system's memory, removing previous immunity to other infections in both humans and ferrets.\n",
      "Scientists have dubbed the startling findings \"immune amnesia.\"\n",
      "While the body is capable of rebuilding those defences, scientists say the process could take years.\n",
      "With measles on the rise in the UK and in other countries across the world, Dr Michael Mina of Harvard's school of public health said \"it should be a scary phenomenon\".\n",
      "Research from the Wellcome Sanger Institute, University of Amsterdam and their collaborators showed that the disease resets the human immune system to an immature state with only limited ability to respond to new infections.\n",
      "Published in the journal Science Immunology, the study explains why children often catch other infectious diseases after measles.\n",
      "The Harvard team analysed blood samples taken from 77 children before and after a measles outbreak in an unvaccinated community in the Netherlands.\n",
      "They looked for antibodies, which remember viruses and bacteria they encounter to guard against a repeat infection.\n",
      "After recovering from measles, the youngsters were left with plenty of antibodies against that virus - but ones they'd previously harboured against other germs had plummeted.\n",
      "In the most severe cases, children were left \"as vulnerable as if they were infants\" said the study's senior author Stephen Elledge, a Harvard geneticist.\n",
      "A separate study, published Thursday in Science Immunology, supported the findings.\n",
      "Scientists said the research has great implications for public health, as falling vaccination rates are resulting in rising cases of measles.\n",
      "They said this in turn could cause an increase in cases of other dangerous infections such as flu, diphtheria or tuberculosis, even in people who were previously immune.\n",
      "In the late 1960s a highly effective measles vaccine was introduced in the UK, and in 2017 the disease had been completely eliminated from the country.\n",
      "However, measles is highly contagious and cases are rising again, with the UK's vaccination uptake dropping below the required level of 95% of the population.\n",
      "This led to the UK losing its World Health Organisation (WHO) measles elimination status in August.\n",
      "In a separate study published in the Science journal, researchers used a tool called VirScan to analyse the responses of antibodies in 77 unvaccinated children aged four to 17 before and after measles infection.\n",
      "The technology tracks antibodies to thousands of viral and microbial antigens in the blood.\n",
      "Led by investigators at Harvard Medical School, Brigham and Women's Hospital and the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health, scientists found the disease wiped out 11% to 73% of the antibody repertoire across individuals two months after measles infection.\n",
      "Professor Michael Mina said: \"Imagine that your immunity against pathogens is like carrying around a book of photographs of criminals, and someone punched a bunch of holes in it.\n",
      "\"It would then be much harder to recognise that criminal if you saw them, especially if the holes are punched over important features for recognition, like the eyes or mouth.\"\n",
      "Prof Mina and colleagues found those who survive measles gradually regain their previous immunity to other viruses and bacteria as they get re-exposed to them.\n",

      "Not so long ago, coming down with measles was seen almost as a rite of passage. Before measles vaccination began in the U.S. in the early 1960s, millions of Americans, many of them children, contracted the virus each year—forcing them to weather a flu-like illness and telltale skin rash, but also bestowing lifelong immunity. As a result, some Americans still view measles as relatively harmless—which, in addition to a dangerous uprising of anti-vaccine sentiment, has led some parents to decline shots for their children, contributing to a resurgence of preventable illness in the U.S. and overseas.\n",
      "A pair of related studies published in Science and Science Immunology, however, busts the myth that measles isn’t dangerous. In addition to being a serious disease in its own right, measles can also virtually wipe out a person’s immune system, leaving them with “immune amnesia” that makes them more susceptible to other diseases, according to the research.\n",
      "Doctors have long known that measles predisposes sufferers to other illnesses. Measles can lead to serious complications like neurological damage, but many of the approximately 110,000 global measles-related deaths each year actually come from concurrent infections like pneumonia. The new studies are among the first to demonstrate why that happens.\n",
      "“Every time we see a pathogen, our immune system recognizes this pathogen, builds immunity to it and then stores it in the form of immune memory,” explains Velislava Petrova, a postdoctoral fellow in immunogenetics at the Wellcome Sanger Institute in the U.K. and first author of the report published in Science Immunology. The measles virus, however, seems to attack these memory cells, effectively leaving sufferers with an immune system that no longer remembers the pathogens to which it has already built up immunity, and thus an impaired ability to fight them off.\n",
      "Petrova and her colleagues conducted their research in a part of the Netherlands with very low measles vaccination rates. They analyzed blood samples from a group of 26 children ages 4 to 17 who were unvaccinated and had never had measles—meaning they could develop the infection organically—both when they were healthy, and again after a measles outbreak in the community. They also used three unvaccinated children who did not develop measles as a control group.\n",
      "Blood sample testing revealed the children who had recovered from measles had the right number of white blood cells, crucial to mounting an immune response and fighting off disease. But sequencing revealed that the types of white blood cells weren’t right. “Our immune cells recover back to normal numbers [after getting measles],” Petrova says, “but they are no longer the same memory cells.”\n",
      "In the related Science study, researchers analyzed the kids’ antibody activity before and after measles infection, and found that, two months after recovery, they had lost up to 73% of their antibody diversity.\n",
      "Not only did the virus wipe out memory cells, it also replaced them with new cells that provide immunity against future measles infection, Petrova says. So, while people who come down with measles are protected from future bouts of that virus, they seem to be left unprotected from other, previously known pathogens and ill-equipped to respond to new ones.\n",
      "The researchers confirmed that finding by infecting flu-vaccinated ferrets with a measles-like illness. After suffering from measles, the animals no longer had immunity against the flu, and experienced more severe flu symptoms, compared to animals that had the flu before contracting measles.\n",
      "Measles “makes our immune system more baby-like,” Petrova says. “Babies are more vulnerable to infections because their immune system is still maturing. That’s what measles does.”\n",
      "Future research, Petrova says, will focus on learning how, exactly, measles—”an immunological paradox”—manages this feat. The answer may lie in the virus’ ability to infiltrate and alter bone marrow, the body’s reservoir for immune cells, she says.\n",
      "More research may be needed, but Petrova emphasizes that there’s plenty of evidence to support measles vaccination now. “Measles is not as harmless of a disease as many people think. The disease itself is a dangerous,” she says. “But what this study shows is vaccination is really important not only to protect us from the disease itself, but also to protect us from other diseases.”\n",

      "Measles causes long-term damage to the immune system, leaving children who have had it vulnerable to other infections long after the initial illness has passed, research has revealed.\n",
      "Two studies of unvaccinated children in an Orthodox Protestant community in the Netherlands found that measles wipes out the immune system’s memory of previous illnesses, returning it to a more baby-like state, and also leaves the body less equipped to fight off new infections.\n",
      "Measles eliminated between 11% and 73% of children’s protective antibodies, the research found.\n",
      "“We’ve found really strong evidence that the measles virus is actually destroying the immune system,” said Prof Stephen Elledge, a geneticist at Harvard Medical School and co-author of one of the papers. “The threat measles poses to people is much greater than we previously imagined.”\n",
      "Related: Drop in vaccination rates in England alarming, experts warn\n",
      "Globally, measles affects more than 7 million people each year and causes more than 100,000 deaths. Reduced vaccination rates have led to a nearly 300% increase in measles infections since 2018.\n",
      "The UK recently lost its measles-free status because of the fall in rates of MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) immunisation. Coverage of 95% of the population is considered necessary to prevent outbreaks. Among children aged 24 months in England, vaccination dropped from 91.2% in 2017-18 to 90.3% in 2018-19, the lowest rate since 2010.\n",
      "Measles is highly contagious and can be spread when someone with the virus coughs, sneezes or exhales. Once inside the respiratory tract, the virus penetrates immune cells that sit at the interface between the lungs and bloodstream. From there, the virus replicates and spreads to immune cells throughout the body.\n",
      "Previously, scientists had inferred a longer-term impact on the immune system because deaths from other infections were seen to go up after a measles outbreak, and because the virus directly attacks the immune system. The latest work for the first time uncovers the extent of the damage.\n",
      "The researchers recruited volunteers from three schools in the Netherlands. They took blood samples from healthy, unvaccinated children aged four to 17 and followed up with 77 of the children who were infected in a measles outbreak in 2013 for repeat sampling.\n",
      "The first paper, led by Velislava Petrova, of the Wellcome Sanger Institute and Cambridge University, says measles erodes two separate lines of defence of the immune system.\n",
      "To tackle previously unseen infections, the immune system relies on constantly pumping out a diverse range of immune cells – thousands of different varieties, each with slightly different receptors on their surfaces, with a collective ability to recognise almost any pathogen.\n",
      "“The more diverse range of them we have, the better,” said Petrova. However, after measles, the children had a far more restricted range.\n",
      "The immune system also creates long-lived memory cells, which remain permanently in circulation, allowing the body to rapidly recognise and eliminate previously encountered infections.\n",
      "However, after measles, a substantial proportion of immune memory cells had disappeared from the children’s blood, in what the scientists described as “immune amnesia”. This could even mean that children who become infected with measles may need to be revaccinated for previous diseases.\n",
      "“We show that measles directly causes the loss of protection to other infectious diseases,” said Petrova.\n",
      "Related: Experience: I nearly died of measles\n",
      "The children in the study were followed up around six weeks after their measles infection, and so it has not yet been established how long it would take for the immune system to recover.\n",
      "“One can speculate that it’s very likely to recover, based on recovery seen in people on immunosuppressive drugs,” said Velislava. “Maybe after five years you would recover.”\n",
      "Elledge’s team looked at antibodies in the blood (the proteins produced by immune cells) and found that 11% to 73% of the antibody memory bank had been erased after measles.\n",
      "The research found that the MMR vaccine itself did not produce immune suppression, meaning that recipients get the benefit of lifelong immunity to measles infection without the damaging effects of natural infection.\n",
      "Petrova said that addressing scepticism around vaccines was a complex task. “We shouldn’t think that scientific data is enough to convince people,” she said. “We need to bring enough reliable information to people at the point of care. Not create polarisation in society around this.”\n",
      "Jonathan Ball, a professor of molecular virology at Nottingham University, who was not involved in the work, said: “In our current climate of falling vaccine uptake rates, this serves as a timely reminder of why MMR immunisation is so important – not only to protect against the viruses the vaccine is designed to target, but also to prevent avoidable follow-on complications that can occur after measles infection.”\n",

      "Joe Rogan, America’s most popular podcaster, recently called for Professor Peter Hotez, an internationally recognized pediatric infectious disease doctor and vaccine scientist, to come on his podcast to debate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (RFK Jr.), a prolific spreader of medical disinformation. Rogan even offered to donate $100,000 to a charity of Hotez’s choice if he agreed to the debate. Hotez declined—instead offering to be a guest on Rogan’s show to discuss vaccine science.\n",
      "Hotez is right not to take the bait. Rogan is unqualified to moderate such a debate, and has himself peddled disinformation about vaccines. Debating anti-vaccine conspiracy theorists like RFK Jr. is a fool’s errand, which always backfires, as history has demonstrated repeatedly. These debates give the false impression that there are “two equivalent sides,” and therefore can cause real public health damage.\n",
      "Historian Andrew Wehrman, an expert on the history of smallpox vaccination in the United States, gives a telling example of the harm that is done when an expert debates an anti-vaxxer. In Minnesota in 1902, the local anti-vaccination league hoped to overturn a law requiring vaccination of schoolchildren against smallpox, managing to organize a debate. Dr. Justus Ohage, a giant of medicine, engaged anti-vaccine advocate W.B. Clarke. Ohage discussed the evidence around the importance of smallpox vaccination. Clarke raised multiple false claims which Ohage was unprepared for (as these could not be fact-checked in real time), and in 1903, the law was repealed. Two decades later, in 1924, Minnesota experienced its deadliest-ever smallpox epidemic, with 500 deaths. “Repealing the childhood vaccination law,” says Wehrman, “cost lives.”\n",
      "Like Clarke, RFK Jr. is, certainly chomping at the bit to debate Hotez. For Kennedy, there are only upsides to such a debate. The event would turn into a media circus akin to the 1902 Minnesota affair, giving Kennedy air time and creating the impression that Kennedy’s views on vaccines should be taken seriously and are reasonable—which is certainly not the case.\n",
      "Read More: Inside the Very Online Campaign of RFK Jr. \n",
      "Much of Kennedy’s opposition to vaccination seems to center on his false claim that vaccines cause autism. But there have now been studies that have included millions of children and these studies have found no relationship between vaccination and autism. One remarkable study looked at every child born in Denmark over a twelve-year period and could not identify an increased risk of autism in the children who were vaccinated relative to those who were not.\n",
      "Indeed, the evidence is very clear: there is no link between vaccination and autism. The best available research evidence suggests that autism is likely to be genetic in nature. The rise in the incidence of autism is attributable largely to evolving diagnostic criteria that are intended to capture more cases and begin earlier intervention. All of this evidence has not stopped anti-vaccine activists like Kennedy from holding steadfast to their false claims, with each successive refutation being met with an excuse.\n",
      "Kennedy also made the false claim that COVID vaccines are the deadliest vaccines ever made. Let’s take a look at this claim.\n",
      "Deaths from vaccines are exceptionally rare for two main reasons. The first is that precautions are taken in who gets vaccinated—for example, the MMR vaccine is a live vaccine, so it is not given to people who are severely immunocompromised. The second is the stringent safety standards that must be met for any vaccine to ever reach the public.\n",
      "Kennedy’s false claim is based on reports of deaths after receipt of COVID-19 vaccines in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). His claim does not hold up to scrutiny, and shows his misunderstanding of VAERS. Anyone can report any event to VAERS. A report of an event is not proof that the vaccine was the cause. Indeed, VAERS’s own disclaimer states: “VAERS reports may contain information that is incomplete, inaccurate, coincidental, or unverifiable.” Deaths reported in VAERS have included car crashes and even the death of a girl who fell into a well—these events were clearly not caused by a vaccine. The main purpose of VAERS is as an early warning system: If there’s a dramatic rise in a particular event, this signal can be investigated with more robust surveillance systems, like the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD), which has access to medical records and can make detailed comparisons between vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. Evidence from these more robust systems has shown that COVID-19 vaccines are remarkably safe and that deaths from the vaccines are extremely rare, which has also been confirmed by studies outside the U.S.\n",
      "In Kennedy’s conspiracy-laden fantasy world, a shadowy cabal conspires to hide the risks of vaccination. In the real world, U.S. public health agencies take vaccine safety extremely seriously and approach it with great transparency. After millions of the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine were given, just 6 cases of an unusual pattern of blood clots were enough to trigger a pause on vaccine—eventually a preferential recommendation for mRNA vaccines was issued because of the seriousness of this very rare condition, one that does not occur from mRNA vaccines. A safety signal for the bivalent Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine for strokes in older adults was immediately communicated when it was identified even though subsequent data suggests that this finding is a statistical artefact.\n",
      "Unfortunately, Kennedy has also argued that COVID-19 vaccines are especially inappropriate in pregnancy. While it is true that the initial studies of the COVID-19 vaccines did not include pregnant individuals, data showing the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines in pregnancy quickly emerged. Pregnant people are at dramatically heightened risk of severe illness and death if they get COVID-19, and vaccination plays a critical role in preventing these awful outcomes. Kennedy’s organization, Children’s Health Defense, has published posts dated as recently as August 2022 arguing that COVID vaccines should be banned in pregnancy, after extensive evidence for their safety and benefits has been available.\n",
      "Kennedy’s brand of extreme anti-vaccine activism can have deadly consequences. In June 2019, he visited Samoa, appearing alongside local anti-vaccine activists. Later that year, a measles outbreak resulted in 83 preventable deaths, most of which were in children under 5, because of poor uptake of the MMR vaccine. Despite the deadly outbreak, Kennedy wrote a letter to Samoa’s Prime Minister Malielegaoi to deflect blame from the anti-vaccine movement and instead suggest that the outbreak was due to a defective MMR vaccine. Physician-scientist David Gorski has provided a thorough dissection of the “deceptive pseudoscientific talking points” in Kennedy’s letter.\n",
      "RFK Jr’s own family say that he is “tragically wrong about vaccines.” They state that he is “part of a misinformation campaign that’s having heartbreaking—and deadly—consequences.” We agree. Kennedy’s views on vaccination are as fringe and detached from reality as it is possible to be, and their dissemination among the public in any format directly harms us all.\n",

      "Here is a look at autism.\n",
      "Autism or autism spectrum disorder (ASD) incorporates a group of neurodevelopmental disorders causing impaired communication skills and social skills. ASD generally starts before three years of age and lasts a lifetime, but early intervention plays a role in treatment and progress.\n",
      "ASD is about four times more common among boys than girls, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n",
      "ASD can be found among all races, ethnicities and socioeconomic groups.\n",
      "The prevalence of ASD in the United States is about one in 36 8-year-olds, according to a 2023 CDC report.\n",
      "Health care costs for children with autism are four to six times greater than medical costs for children without autism, according to research published in the Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders.\n",
      "April 2 is World Autism Day.\n",
      "There is no definitive medical test to diagnose autism. Instead, the disorder is diagnosed by observing a child’s development.\n",
      "According to the CDC, signs of autism may include deficits in social communication and interaction in a variety of contexts, difficulty engaging in back-and-forth conversation and an absence of interest in forming friendships with peers.\n",
      "The debate over whether autism spectrum disorders are caused by vaccines started in 1998 when the medical journal The Lancet published a now-retracted study by researcher Andrew Wakefield linking the MMR vaccine to autism.\n",
      "Most of Wakefield’s co-authors withdrew their names from the study when they learned he had been compensated by a law firm intending to sue manufacturers of the vaccine in question. In 2010, Wakefield lost his medical license. In 2011, the Lancet retracted the study after an investigation found Wakefield altered or misrepresented information on the 12 children who were the basis for the conclusion of the study.\n",
      "Other researchers have not been able to replicate Wakefield’s findings. Several subsequent studies trying to reproduce the results have found no link between vaccines and autism, including several reviews by the Institute of Medicine.\n",

      "Matt Halprin, the global head of trust and safety at YouTube, said vaccine misinformation was a global problem and had spilled over from the spreading of falsehoods about Covid jabs.\n",
      "“Vaccine misinformation appears globally, it appears in all countries and cultures,” he said.\n",
      "Halprin added that falsehoods around the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine, which has been wrongly attributed to causing autism, were an example of the misinformation YouTube will target.\n",
      "“There is still a lot of challenges around MMR and people arguing whether that causes autism. And as we know, the science is very stable that vaccines do not cause autism,” he said.\n",

In contrast, countries that have the lowest levels of populist votes, such as Portugal and Belgium, also have the lowest levels of vaccine hesitancy.\n",
      "The link between populism and vaccine hesitancy can be seen when we look at individual-level data. Survey results published in The Economist in 2014 showed that UKIP voters were almost five times more likely to believe that tMMR vaccine is unsafe. According to more recent data, which I helped The Guardian analyse, one-third of UKIP voters believed vaccines were unsafe compared with 10% of Labour voters and 11% of Conservative voters. We found similar patterns throughout Europe: supporters of right-wing populist parties were much more likely to question the safety of vaccines.\n",

      "It is interesting to note that the three other European countries that lost their measles-free status are also in the midst of profound crises precipitated by a breakdown in trust in the politicians.\n",
      "In June, Albania’s elections were boycotted by the main opposition party who accused the prime minister of previous electoral fraud and corruption. In the Czech Republic, hundreds of thousands of people have taken to the streets this summer to protest against alleged economic fraud perpetrated by the billionaire prime minister Andrej Babiš. Greeks have suffered massively since 2008, with GDP still 20% lower than pre-crisis levels. Alexis Tsipras’ left-wing government was recently defeated by New Democracy, which has been described by some observers as a right-wing populist party.\n",
      "All this shows how political crises and measles go hand in hand. Just as Boris Johnson’s manoeuvring does not undo all the progress that has occurred in British politics since Charles I, the UK losing its measles-free status does not signify a return to the Dark Ages. It is nevertheless alarming to see how precarious both the rule of law and public health are in the current political climate.\n",

      "What changed? In recent years, the “anti-vaxxer” movement has flooded social media platforms with misinformation questioning the safety of vaccinations. Articles, videos and posts replete with conspiracy theories, hoaxes and pseudoscience have, well, gone viral. Many people have been persuaded to make health-care decisions based on provocative, frightening and false content that puts their children, and their communities, at risk.\n",
      "The internet often acts as an echo chamber, serving up content to reinforce a person’s opinions regardless of compelling evidence to the contrary. Anti-vaxxers have benefited from this phenomenon. New York Times columnist Frank Bruni wrote this about them in March: “They turn to the internet, which is both a hall of mirrors and an overstuffed bazaar. It lets them customize their input and thus tailor their reality, which is reinforced by the like-minded company they keep online.”\n",

Most recently, a study published in April in the Annals of Internal Medicine looked at data from more than 650,000 children in Denmark and found no link between autism and the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine. Yet those false claims persist.\n",
      "The tangible consequences from the anti-vaxxers’ misinformation campaigns are lower rates of vaccination and the all-but-inevitable outbreaks of disease. Those who refuse to vaccinate their children not only put their sons and daughters at risk, but potentially make others who come into contact with them vulnerable as well.\n",

      "【健康醫療網／記者蔡岳宏外電報導】MMR疫苗不會增加自閉症風險！一項丹麥涉及65萬人的研究再度證實，預防腮腺炎，麻疹和德國麻疹的MMR疫苗，不會增加罹患自閉症風險，也不會加劇自閉症高風險兒童的罹病機率，也與施打疫苗後出現自閉症案例無關。\n",
      "MMR與自閉症有關 源自假論文\n",
      "根據《現場科學》報導，MMR疫苗引起自閉症爭議起於1998年，當時一名英國醫師Andrew Wakefield在知名科學期刊《刺胳針》發表一篇研究指出，在觀察12名孩童注射MMR疫苗後，幾乎所有孩童都在數小時內出現不良反應。Wakefield認為，MMR疫苗是造成自閉症的元凶。\n",
      "當時這篇研究引起媒體爭相報導，甚至許多名人都公開反對疫苗。然而，後續許多研究都無法驗證這篇爭議研究的結果。後來學界才發現這是一篇捏造的假研究，《刺胳針》於2011年撤銷此論文，這名醫生甚至在前一年就已被剝奪醫師資格。\n",
      "然而，質疑MMR疫苗的傳言從來沒有停止。假論文發表數十年內，英國麻疹疫情大爆發。甚至直到2018年，各國都因為各種質疑疫苗安全的聲浪，讓美國、菲律賓和法國等十個國家的麻疹疫情增加近四分之三，世界衛生組織估計全球增加48.4％。\n",
      "大型研究再度驗證 MMR疫苗無關自閉症\n",
      "為再度驗證MMR疫苗與自閉症無關，丹麥團隊追蹤1999-2010年間在丹麥出生的657,000名兒童，其中有6,500名孩童被診斷處於自閉症光譜上。\n",
      "研究發現，無論是男孩、女孩或是手足有自閉症的族群，都不會因為施打MMR疫苗而增加自閉症的風險。其中，被指控與MMR疫苗最相關的倒退型自閉症，也沒有關聯。有趣的是，施打MMR疫苗甚至與1999-2001年出生的女孩自閉症風險較低有關。\n",
      "高風險族群 基因或高齡生產\n",
      "自閉症的成因目前仍然不明，但該研究確實也發現，2008-2010年出生的孩童，沒有及早接種疫苗的兒童，以及有自閉症手足的孩童，這些族群罹患自閉症風險最高。其他風險因子，包括高齡父母，出生體重較低，早產和母親於懷孕期間吸煙。\n",
      "醫籲家長放心 不打疫苗風險更大\n",
      "非研究人員、費城兒童醫院疫苗教育中心主任Paul Offit向《CNN》表示，這項研究最大的貢獻，是特別納入自閉症高風險的孩童。他希望最新的證據讓這些家長放心，疫苗不會增加罹患自閉症的風險。\n",
      "世界衛生組織今年剛把疫苗猶豫列為十大健康威脅。Offit對此強調，「民眾需要意識到，選擇不接種疫苗其實也在冒險。不幸的是，我們正面臨更大的風險。」\n",

      "With New York state facing one of its most severe measles outbreaks in decades, public health officials in a suburban community took the extraordinary step in December of banning unvaccinated students from attending school, regardless of whether they had received religious or medical exemptions for the vaccine.\n",
      "The parents of 42 children affected by the ban at the school, the Green Meadow Waldorf School, sued the Rockland County health department, asking a federal judge to issue an injunction to allow the children to return.\n",
      "On Tuesday, the request was denied.\n",
      "In a hearing at US District Court in White Plains, judge Vincent Bricetti said the parents failed to prove “that public interest weighs in favour of granting an injunction,” according to The Journal News.\n",
      "“While no one enjoys the fact that these kids are out of school, these orders have worked,” the county’s attorney, Thomas E Humbach, said in a statement about the decision. “They have helped prevent the measles outbreak from spreading to this school population.”\n",
      "The decision added to a growing public pushback against people who do not vaccinate their children. Last week, an Ohio teenager who got vaccinated against his family’s wishes testified before Congress that he believed his mother had fallen prey to widely debunked conspiracy theories about immunisation dangers.\n",
      "Days later, New York lawmakers proposed a bill to allow teenagers to get vaccinated without parental consent. On Monday, local chapters of the American Academy of Paediatrics expressed their support for the legislation.\n",
      "So far, no confirmed cases of measles had been reported at Green Meadow, a private school offering early childhood and K-12 programs that, like other Waldorf schools, follow a teaching philosophy focused on nondenominational spiritual development.\n",
      "But Rockland County has been the epicentre of the measles outbreak in New York, with 146 confirmed cases since October, the vast majority of them among those 18 and under. Many cases have involved members of Orthodox Jewish communities where vaccination rates tend to be lower than average, public health officials have said.\n",
      "All of the children at the centre of the lawsuit had received approved religion-based exemptions to vaccination, according to Michael Sussman, a lawyer for the parents who sued Rockland’s health department. But neither they nor their parents are Orthodox Jews, he said.\n",
      "Rockland County’s so-called “exclusion orders” in December was the first time county officials had taken the step to ban unvaccinated children from schools, a county spokesperson said. Under the orders, unvaccinated children were not allowed to attend targeted schools until the school’s vaccination rate reached 95 per cent.\n",
      "Even when schools did not have confirmed cases of measles, as with Green Meadow, officials were still worried that unvaccinated children could be exposed to measles in other public places, like shopping malls, and would then spread the disease at their schools, said Ed Day, the Rockland County executive.\n",
      "At one point, 60 schools, many of them in ultra-Orthodox communities, and 6,000 students were affected by the orders, officials said. About half of the schools have reached the required vaccination rate, county officials said.\n",
      "The complaint filed in court said that Rockland County officials violated the children’s constitutional rights by forcing them to stay home. The order also “substantially disrupted” the children’s education, the complaint said.\n",
      "Vicki Larson, a spokesperson for Green Meadow, said the school had no official stance on vaccinations but was complying with New York state law, which allows religious exemptions to vaccination and immunisation requirements.\n",
      "But she said that the school was following the county’s exclusion order and working with the Rockland County Health Department. To return to school students would have to prove immunity to measles or receipt of the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccination, she said.\n",
      "“We’re ready to welcome back our excluded students as soon as it’s legally possible,” Ms Larson said.\n",

      "There is no increased risk of autism from common childhood vaccines, another large study has found.\n",
      "Seventeen years after a significant study examined the relationship between the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, or MMR, and autism, researchers have again determined that children who receive the vaccines are not at a higher risk of developing autism.\n",
      "“The study strongly supports that MMR vaccination does not increase the risk for autism, does not trigger autism in susceptible children, and is not associated with clustering of autism cases after vaccination,” the researchers wrote in the study, published in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine, from the American College of Physicians.\n",
      "The research comes as anti-vaxxers continue to rally against vaccines because they believe they cause autism, despite significant scientific research to the contrary and assurances from the Centers for Disease Control about the safety of vaccines. Over the last year, there has been a 30 percent increase in measles cases worldwide and deadly outbreaks in areas with large amounts of unvaccinated children. In January, the World Health Organization named vaccine hesitancy — the “reluctance or refusal to vaccinate despite the availability” — as one of the top threats to global health in 2019.\n",
      "For this study, the researchers analyzed data from 657,461 children born in Denmark between 1999 and 2010. During that time, 6,517 of the children were diagnosed with autism, but the chance of developing autism was no higher for those who got the MMR vaccinations and those who did not.\n",
      "Additionally, there was no increased risk of autism for children who got the MMR vaccine and were also members of other subgroups — siblings of children with autism, children with other risk factors for autism and children who received other childhood vaccinations.\n",

      "The researchers said that they conducted this study after their 2002 study on the same topic — published in the New England Journal of Medicine — because of the continued vaccine hesitancy.\n",
      "“The idea that vaccines cause autism is still around despite our original and other well-conducted studies,” Anders Hviid, the study’s first author and an epidemiologist at the Staten Serum Institute in Copenhagen, told NPR. “Parents still encounter these claims on social media, by politicians, by celebrities, etc.”\n",
      "In an editorial accompanying the study, Hviid and his fellow researchers added that the “fraudulent” belief that vaccines lead to autism was due to a false and “subsequently retracted” study from 20 years ago that theirs and other research has since debunked. But the misinformation led to a significant decrease in vaccinations.\n",
      "“Despite substantial limitations, the study received wide publicity, and the claims published in the article contributed to damaging confidence in the safety of the MMR vaccine, leading to a sharp drop in vaccination rates in the United Kingdom and, possibly, in other countries,” the editorial states.\n",
      "Hviid said he hopes that the facts presented in their study will assure parents that “MMR does not cause autism,” as he told NPR.\n",

      "The findings by a Danish team were intended to reassure the growing number of people making the unfounded link between vaccines and conditions including autism.\n",
      "They come after a 30 per cent rise in the number of measles cases being reported, which the World Health Organisation has attributed in part to parents shunning vaccines.\n",
      "Alongside pandemics, climate change and HIV, WHO listed so-called “anti-vax” ideas as one of the biggest threats to global health in 2019.\n",
      "While vaccines themselves come with minimal risk, measles is a highly infectious disease that can sometimes cause seizures, brain inflammation and even death.\n",
      "MMR vaccines are distributed free to all children on the NHS, and yet the number of children receiving them in the UK each year has been falling.\n",
      "Doubts about the vaccine were initially sparked by the discredited former physician Andrew Wakefield, who published a since retracted paper suggesting a link between MMR and autism in 1998.\n",
      "Despite being thoroughly disproved, this theory has helped fuel a rise in measles outbreaks from the US to Europe in recent years as anti-vaxxer parents refuse to vaccinate their children.\n",
      "“Parents should not skip the vaccine out of fear for autism,” lead study author Dr Anders Hviid of the Statens Serum Institut told Reuters.\n",
      "“The dangers of not vaccinating includes a resurgence in measles which we are seeing signs of today in the form of outbreaks.”\n",
      "In their study, the team – which had previously undertaken one of the first studies to discredit Mr Wakefield’s ideas – followed up their cohort of children until some of them were 14.\n",
      "Around 1 per cent of the children developed autism, but there was no significant different in rates of autism between those who had the jab and those that did not.\n",
      "This was even the case among children at higher risk of autism due to having a sibling that already had the condition.\n",
      "They published their findings in the Annals of Internal Medicine.\n",
      "In a piece written to accompany the study, Dr Saad Omer and Dr Inci Yildirim from Emory University said it was worth carrying out such extensive research to hammer home the truth about vaccines and autism.\n",

Their latest work involves 6,517 cases of autism, the biggest number to date, among 650,000 children on the Danish population registry, followed over 10 years.\n",
      "Dr Anders Peter Hviid from the Statens Serum Institut in Copenhagen said: “That [2002 study] was published in the New England Journal of Medicine 16 years ago, but it hasn’t dispelled this idea that vaccination causes autism.\n",
      "“I remember a couple of years ago we even saw Donald Trump in his presidential campaign tweet about vaccines causing autism.”\n",
      "Researchers aimed to specifically address some of the criticisms of the anti-vaccination lobby, such as the suggestion that some groups of children were more vulnerable to autism following MMR vaccination than others. The researchers looked at children with a sibling who has autism and those with increased risk factors for autism, such as older parents.\n",
      "They also looked at whether there was more autism among children who had received other vaccinations before MMR. Anti-MMR campaigners have also made claims of “clusters” of a regressive form of autism, caused by vaccination, which do not show up in whole population studies.\n",
      "All these theories were tested in the study, said Hviid, and found to be false.\n",
      "“We found no support for the hypothesis of increased risk for autism after MMR vaccination in a nationwide unselected population of Danish children, no support for the hypothesis of MMR vaccination triggering autism in susceptible subgroups characterised by environmental and familial risk factors, and no support for a clustering of autism cases in specific time periods after MMR vaccination,” the paper said.\n",
      "Related: Vaccine scepticism grows in line with rise of populism - study\n",
      "In the study’s editorial, Saad Omer from the Rollins School of Public Health at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, and Inci Yildirim from Emory University’s School of Medicine said the study was worth carrying out, even though it had already been shown there was no link between MMR and autism.\n",
      "“In an ideal world, vaccine safety research would be conducted only to evaluate scientifically grounded hypotheses, not in response to the conspiracy du jour. In reality, hypotheses propagated by vaccine sceptics can affect public confidence in vaccines,” they wrote.\n",
      "The study may not be enough, they admitted: “It has been said that we now live in a ‘fact-resistant’ world where data have limited persuasive value. So how do physicians and public health officials debunk the MMR–autism myth?”\n",
      "Omer and Yildirim offered three suggestions. First, any vaccine myth should be clearly labelled as such, they said, calling for headlines on stories not to suggest links that are then dispelled in the text. Second, when correcting incorrect information, scientists should focus on the key facts and not try to answer everything. Third, “an alternative explanation of the perceived phenomenon should be provided”. Otherwise, they added, the chances were the doubter would go back to their previous beliefs.\n",

      "The MMR vaccine is linked to lower rates of autism, the largest ever study has shown, as parents were urged to ignore anti-vaccination campaigns and make sure their children had the jab.\n",
      "The new study by Danish researchers found children who had the measles, mumps and rubella vaccination were seven per cent less likely to be autistic than those who missed the injection.\n",
      "Although scientists warned the result was not great enough to demonstrate a protective effect, they said the science was now unequivocal that there is no link between the MMR jab and autism.\n",
      "Lead author Dr Anders Peter Hviid, of the Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen, said: “MMR is not associated with autism. I would say that this is very strong scientific evidence against an association.\n",
      "“I think it is understandable that some parents are uncertain and concerned given the anti-vaccine stories that are easy to encounter on the internet. However, the science is clear, there is no link.”\n",
      "Parents are urged to take up the offer of MMR vaccination for their children at 1 year of age and as a pre-school booster at 3 years and 4 months of age.\n",
      "But there have been concerns about the jab since doctor Andrew Wakefield published a paper in The Lancet in 1998, suggesting a link to autism.\n",
      "At the peak of the scare, one in five children missed out on the vaccination. The paper was later withdrawn and Dr Wakefield struck off after the research was found to be dishonest.\n",
      "In recent years Public Health England (PHE) has reported a steep rise in cases of measles, with 913 laboratory confirmed cases between January and October last year compared with just 259 in 2017.\n",
      "Many cases were teenagers and young adults who missed out on their MMR vaccine when they were younger.\n",
      "Last week the head of the NHS, Sir Simon Stevens, warned that ‘fake news’ on social media has fueled a tripling in measles cases.\n",
      "Mr Stevens said that parents who failed to get their children vaccinated were as irresponsible as if they failed to teach their children to look left and right before crossing the road.\n",
      "For the new study, a nationwide cohort of 657,461 children born between 1999 and 2010 were followed to see if a link could be found between autism and the MMR jab. 6,517 were diagnosed during the study, a ratio of just under 1 per cent. But the chance of was slightly higher for those who had not had the jab.\n",
      "There was also no more increased risk for children who had autism in the family, nor evidence of geographical clusterings of cases which would suggest the jab was having an impact.\n",
      "Uptake of the MMR vaccine is now at 87.5 percent in Britain, making it short of the 95 per cent that the World Health Organisation target.\n",
      "Commenting on the research, Helen Bedford Professor of Children’s Health at UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health said: “Parents deciding whether to have their child vaccinated should be reassured by this further evidence.\n",
      "“The decision to immunise is important and I would strongly advise parents with questions or concerns about vaccines to speak with their GP, health visitor or practice nurse first rather than basing their decision on material they may have read on the Internet or social media. Such information is unregulated and misinformation is widespread.”\n",
      "Dr Andrew Freeman, a reader in infectious diseases at Cardiff University added: \"I think any study that debunks the erroneous link between MMR & autism is helpful, especially with the ongoing anti-vaxx lobby & continuing concerns with low MMR uptake. \n",
      "\"This is a large retrospective case control study - so the strengths are that it contains a large number of children diagnosed with autism, comparing those that had & those that hadn’t received MMR. \n",
      "\"It also studied children in specific higher risk groups for the development of autism (sibling with autism, low birth weight, older fathers or mother, smoking in pregnancy etc) & again found no increased risk with MMR in these groups.\"\n",

      "By Michael Taylor\n",
      "KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 31 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The amount of planet-warming carbon emitted by the world's lost tropical forests has been under-reported as estimates failed to take into account the longer-term effects of tree destruction, researchers said.\n",
      "A new international study re-evaluated the carbon impacts of forests that were destroyed or degraded between 2000 and 2013, adding up to 49 million hectares (121 million acres), roughly the size of Spain.\n",
      "The carbon released from losses to those \"intact forests\" will amount to more than six times previous estimates when additional emissions caused by changes to the forest up to 2050 are included, it found.\n",
      "Intact forests are large areas of continuous forest with no signs of intensive human activity, like agriculture or logging.\n",
      "\"Once you've caused the initial round of damage, you have committed to a lot of further emissions in the future once the forest has opened up,\" said study co-author Tom Evans of the New York-based Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS).\n",
      "\"It's a bit like if you're injured at work you have lost earnings for years into the future,\" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. \"Those carbon lost earnings turn out to be the biggest part of the picture for these intact forests.\"\n",
      "Trees suck carbon dioxide from the air, and store carbon, the main greenhouse gas heating up the Earth's climate. But they release it when they are cut down and are burned or rot.\n",
      "Environmentalists say protecting existing forests and restoring damaged ones prevents flooding, limits climate change and protects biodiversity.\n",
      "The tropics lost 12 million hectares of tree cover in 2018, the fourth-highest annual loss since records began in 2001, according to forest monitoring service Global Forest Watch.\n",
      "Of greatest concern, it said, was the disappearance of 3.6 million hectares of old-growth rainforest, an area the size of Belgium, much due to fires, land-clearing for farms and mining.\n",
      "Areas analysed in the new study, published in the journal Science Advances, included intact forests lost in the Amazon and Congo basins and on Southeast Asia's islands.\n",
      "While previous research largely focused on stored carbon losses directly linked to deforestation, the new study also took into account the knock-on and future effects.\n",
      "Those include indiscriminate logging around newly opened up forest areas as they become more accessible and a rise in hunting that limits the spread of seeds and hinders forest regeneration.\n",
      "Over time, the carbon-storing abilities of the new forest edges created by deforestation also decline as human and grazing activities increase and temperatures change.\n",
      "\"Once you open up a forest, there are several forms of damage that lead to that dwindling of carbon stocks,\" said Evans, adding that undamaged forests also become more carbon-rich each year.\n",
      "These effects tend to get overlooked in carbon accounting used to work out how and where to target conservation incentives and provide payments for preventing forest loss, he added.\n",
      "In 2013, the world had about 549 million hectares of intact tropical forests left, the study said.\n",
      "Ensuring their future should now be a priority, with increased efforts and policies to keep them safe, Evans said.\n",
      "That should include better recognition of indigenous land rights and a halt to the expansion of mining, fossil fuel extraction, agriculture and infrastructure which often drives forest loss, he added.\n",
      "\"Our results revealed that continued destruction of intact tropical forests is a ticking time bomb for carbon emissions,\" the study's lead author Sean Maxwell, a scientist with Australia's University of Queensland, said in a statement.\n",
      "\"There is an urgent need to safeguard these landscapes because they play an indispensable role in stabilising the climate.\" (Reporting by Michael Taylor @MickSTaylor; editing by Megan Rowling.

      "Greenhouse gas emissions caused by damage to tropical rainforests around the world are being underestimated by a factor of six, according to a new study.\n",
      "Research led by the University of Queensland finds the climate impact of selective logging, outright clearing and fire in tropical rainforests between 2000 and 2013 was underestimated by 6.53bn tonnes of CO2.\n",
      "The numbers are likely conservative, and also did not include emissions from other woodlands or the massive boreal forests in the high latitudes of the northern hemisphere.\n",
      "Related: Review of federal environment laws will cut 'green tape' and speed up approvals\n",
      "Study co-author professor James Watson of the University of Queensland and the Wildlife Conservation Society said: “We have been treating forests as pretty one-dimensional, but we know degradation impacts carbon. The bottom line is that we knew the numbers would be big, but we were shocked at just how big.”\n",
      "Watson said the numbers used for tropical rainforests were “conservative”, adding, “this is a carbon time bomb and policymakers have to get to grips with this”.\n",
      "When countries declare greenhouse gas emissions from changes in forests, they do not account for the CO2 that forests would have continued to soak up for decades had they not been cleared or damaged. This is a measure known as “forgone removal”.\n",
      "The study, published in the journal Science Advances, also accounted for those emissions up to the year 2050 – a timeframe relevant to the global Paris climate change agreement.\n",
      "The study found 6.53bn tonnes of CO2 for foregone emissions and the impacts of other damage that wasn’t being counted.\n",
      "In comparison, for the year to March 2019, Australia’s emissions are at 538.9m tonnes CO2e (carbon dioxide equivalent) – or 0.54bn tonnes of CO2e. Global emissions from burning coal in 2017 were 14.6bn tonnes of CO2.\n",
      "“Frankly, inside the environment movement there has been a huge push to get a handle on coal-based emissions, and the role of transport and airplanes. That’s important, but the forgotten child has been forests and woodlands,” Watson said.\n",
      "The study only counted emissions from tropical forests. In total, the world’s forests soaked up about 28% of human-caused emissions between 2007 and 2016, with tropical forests accounting for about half that absorption.\n",
      "“We have only looked at tropical forests and we have not looked at woodlands,” Watson said. “We also don’t look at the boreal forests which are the biggest game in town. Those numbers would be staggering. This story would be seriously worse if we looked at the whole vegetation estate.\n",
      "“From a policy point of view, this is a horror story, but it also points to a simple solution,” he said, adding that keeping forests intact and properly accounting for the benefits would put countries like Australia at a “massive competitive advantage”.\n",
      "Lead author Sean Maxwell of University of Queensland said: “Usually only ‘pulse’ emissions are considered – these are emissions released the instant intact forest is destroyed. Our analysis considers all impacts such as the effects of selective logging, forgone carbon sequestration, expanding effects on the edges of forests and species extinction.”\n",
      "Related: Australia’s beloved native birds are disappearing – and the cause is clear | The Conversation\n",
      "Pep Canadell of the CSIRO and the Global Carbon Project, who was not involved in the study, said the findings were highly relevant.\n",
      "“This brings lots of pieces together to show that if our ultimate goal from conservation was climate change, then there are many more components that we are not taking into account in our carbon accounting,” he said. “These researchers are calling this out.\n",
      "“I think the numbers [in the study] are reasonable. They have developed a framework where we can better include the long-term value of the conservation of forests for the sake of the climate.”\n",

      "The loss of pristine tropical forests has a far greater impact on climate change than previously thought, scientists have warned.\n",
      "Analysis led by the University of Queensland in Australia suggests that once all the emissions associated with clearing intact tropical forests are taken into account, the impact on the climate is more than six times worse than thought.\n",
      "The researchers looked at the loss of intact tropical forests – tracts of woods which are free of significant human activity – between 2000 and 2013.\n",
      "They examined not only the immediate carbon emissions of clearing and burning woods usually used as a measure, but also estimated other impacts.\n",
      "These include selective logging within the forests, the impacts of fragmentation and damage to the edge of wooded areas and even the decline of trees as a result of a reduction in the wildlife who spread their seeds.\n",
      "The study, published in the journal Science Advances, also took into account the carbon that would have been stored by the forests that were lost between 2000 and 2013 if they had remained intact up to 2050.\n",
      "University of Queensland conservation scientist Dr Sean Maxwell said: “Usually only ‘pulse’ emissions are considered – these are emissions released the instant intact forest is destroyed.\n",
      "“Our analysis considers all impacts such as the effects of selective logging, forgone carbon sequestration, expanding effects on the edges of forests, and species extinction.\n",
      "“We were shocked to see that when considering all of the available factors, the net carbon impact was more than six times worse for the climate.”\n",
      "And he said: “Our results revealed that continued destruction of intact tropical forests is a ticking time bomb for carbon emissions.\n",
      "“There is an urgent need to safeguard these landscapes because they play an indispensable role in stabilising the climate.”\n",
      "The researchers said the difference equated to two years of emissions from changes to land use across the world.\n",
      "In 2013, there were 549 million hectares of intact tropical forest remaining globally, but the researchers warn they are being lost at an increasing rate and the opportunity to use them to curb climate change was dwindling.\n",
      "Most of the focus for conserving forests to reduce emissions is on curbing clearance in areas with high historical rates of deforestation, or on restoration.\n",
      "But the University of Queensland and Wildlife Conservation Society’s Professor James Watson said the study’s approach better captured the true carbon impact of the loss of intact forests.\n",
      "“Humanity needs to better fund the conservation of intact forests, especially now we’ve shown their larger-than-realised role in stabilising the climate.\n",
      "“Our study will hopefully mobilise more funding from the climate finance sector, improving and expanding efforts to retain intact forests across the tropics,” he said.\n",

      "The newly documented cougar-donkey dynamic has been the focus of little research, but it might illustrate a developing relationship between the two animals that could benefit the ecosystem, according to a recent study.\n",
      "The feral donkeys, also known as burros, have long been considered invasive and major disruptors of native species and habitats in Death Valley, pillaging wetlands and destroying vegetation other animals rely on. But Lundgren is hoping this study could shift how conservationists and researchers view the donkeys.\n",
      "\"I was interested in the wild donkeys, not just as a pest ... but as wildlife,\" said Lundgren, the lead researcher of the report published in the Journal of Animal Ecology. \"Which is, I think, how you should study them if you want to understand them.\"\n",
      "Not only did the study find the donkeys were the \"primary recorded prey\" of mountain lions in certain areas of the national park but also that the presence of the big cats changed how and when the donkeys fed, roamed and congregated, and their interaction formed an \"emerging ecological network.\"\n",
      "The increased predation \"was associated with altered donkey activity patterns and rates, and with reduced herbivory and disturbance-related effects on desert wetlands,\" the study found. This limited damage from the donkeys in these areas.\n",
      "\"There's a prevailing narrative that wild horses and wild burros are problems ... at some kind of biological level,\" Lundgren said. \"And I think that's really non-scientific.\"\n",
      "However, in areas where the mountain lions were not as active, the study found donkeys continued to wreak havoc, the study found.\n",
      "Although the wild donkeys are not native to North America — they descended from the domesticated African wild ass, which was brought west by pioneers during the Gold Rush — Lundgren notes the region was home to different horse-like species before the last Ice Age that lived alongside prehistoric mountain lions more than 10,000 years ago.\n",
      "\"Mountain lions co-occurred with equids [horse-related species], just like wild donkeys, for several million years,\" he said. \"So it's kind of neat that they're together again and that these new relationships are unfolding, which in many ways mimic old relationships that were around for millions of years.\"\n",
      "For Mairin Balisi, a paleontologist and co-author of the study, the images of the mountain lion kill were the \"return of an extinct interaction.\"\n",
      "\"Fossil ecosystems are useful for providing baselines of conservation,\" said Balisi, a curator at the Raymond M. Alf Museum of Paleontology in Claremont.\n",
      "She said this evolving relationship in Death Valley has the potential to be a natural experiment in how the two species can benefit each other and the surrounding habitat. She likens the interaction to the successful reintroduction of the gray wolf in Yellowstone National Park, which had a positive effect on the food chain.\n",
      "But currently, Death Valley officials remain committed to their zero burro goal in the park, given how a consensus of prior research shows the animals \"denude vegetation at springs (sometimes completely), foul water with their excrement and prevent native wildlife, such as native bighorn sheep, from using springs,\" Death Valley spokesperson Abby Wines said.\n",
      "\"Mountain lion predation is not sufficient to control the burro population in the park,\" Wines said.\n",
      "There are an estimated 4,000 feral burros on parkland today, a drastic increase from about 400 in 2005, she said. National park leaders have worked in recent years to humanely remove the burros from the park.\n",
      "Kate Schoenecker, a research wildlife biologist for the U.S. Geological Survey at Fort Collins Science Center who studies wild burros, said it's unlikely Death Valley will be able to eliminate the animals, given their protected status on nearby Bureau of Land Management and U.S. Forest Service land.\n",
      "She didn't question the park's efforts to remove the donkeys through trapping efforts, but said she was excited the new study gave a more in-depth look at the understudied burros. Specifically, she pointed out how the research documented the donkeys' \"predator-risk avoidance behavior,\" which can positively affect ecosystems.\n",
      "\"This is really cool because it's never been studied for burros,\" said Schoenecker, who noted the difficulty in drawing too many conclusions from the recent study given its small sample size and limited data.\n",
      "\"I think there's a lot we still don't know,\" Schoenecker said. \"We're just still learning about basic demographic rates of burros.\"\n",
      "Lundgren and Balisi agree there should be more research on the wild donkeys and their broader effects on the ecosystem.\n",
      "\"Ecologically important predator-prey interactions can emerge rapidly in novel ecosystems,\" Lundgren said, noting he is concerned that total removal of the burros could have unintended consequences for the larger food chain and how continued threats to mountain lions could stunt this potentially beneficial relationship.\n",

      "Forest elephant extinction would exacerbate climate change. That’s according to a new study in Nature Geoscience which links feeding by elephants with an increase in the amount of carbon that forests are able to store.\n",
      "The bad news is that African forest elephants – smaller and more vulnerable relatives of the better known African bush elephant – are fast going extinct. If we allow their ongoing extermination to continue, we will be also worsening climate change. The good news is that if we protect and conserve these elephants, we will simultaneously fight climate change.\n",
      "Elephants are fascinating animals, and I have studied them for more than 15 years. They are intelligent, sentient, and highly social. But their single most remarkable feature is their size. Evolutionarily, elephants gambled on becoming massive enough to deter predators like lions and tigers.\n",
      "In exchange, they became slaves to their appetite. Elephants need huge amounts of food everyday, something like 5-10% of their body mass. A typical three-tonne female could eat 200 kg of plant material in one day. Her family may need to consume more than a tonne of food per day.\n",
      "It is not easy to find so much food, especially in tropical rain forests, where plants have high concentrations of chemical defences (toxins) to avoid being eaten. Elephants spend most of their life eating and looking for food. We can think of them as “eating machines”. African forest elephants are particularly fond of saplings, young trees, and the plants that first grow into newly opened gaps in the forest. These “early succession” plants are specialised in growing fast following a disturbance and they invest less in chemical defences. Early succession trees also have lower wood density than slow-growing late-succession tree species.\n",
      "Elephant eating manners are also remarkable. They feed by breaking stems and branches, pulling down lianas, uprooting whole plants, stripping leaves off twigs, and so on. It is easy to notice their presence because of the mess they leave behind.\n",
      "The key novelty of the new study, by the ecologist Fabio Berzaghi and colleagues, is they include, for the first time, the effect of elephant feeding disturbances in a computer model that simulates demographic processes in forest ecosystems. They found that “elephant disturbance” – all that messy eating – results in forests having fewer, larger trees. Elephants filter out small early-succession (i.e. low wood density) trees, promoting the dominance of late-succession (high wood density) trees, which ultimately leads to long-term increases in the total biomass. Berzaghi and colleagues were able to validate their model predictions with data from real forest plots in the Congo Basin.\n",
      "By promoting these larger, woodier trees, elephant feeding disturbances therefore mean the forest stores more carbon. These results have important and far reaching implications for elephant conservation and carbon policy. The authors estimate that the disappearance of African forest elephants would result in a loss of as much as 7% of the carbon stocks in Central African forests, which they valued at around US$43 billion, based on a conservative carbon stock price. In short, forest elephants are our allies in the fight against climate change and their existence saves us tens of billions of dollars in climate responses.\n",
      "The situation of African forest elephants is particularly dramatic. Once numbered in the millions, their population is now less than 10% of its potential size and, in the decade from 2002 to 2011, as many as 62% of forest elephants might have been killed. This decline is mostly due to poaching to feed Asian demand for ivory as well as increasing human encroaching of their habitats. What a sad reason for a massacre and an ecological disaster.\n",
      "Scientists largely recognise African bush (Loxodonta africana) and forest (L. cyclotis) elephants as different species. However because of practical challenges (such as dealing with abundant hybrid populations), the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), which officially tracks endangered species, has kept the two together. The problem is that the more populous bush elephants have masked a drastic reduction in their forest cousins.\n",
      "Berzaghi and colleagues emphasise the need for forest elephants to be finally acknowledged as their own species. This would give them a separate IUCN Red List status – probably marked as “endangered” – and trigger important policies and actions.\n",
      "Berzaghi and colleagues show that forest elephants produce ecosystem services in the form of climate stability from which we all benefit, including people like you and me who might never visit the forests of Central Africa. If we are all beneficiaries of elephant conservation, we should be also responsible for it. It is very important that more affluent societies assume a bigger share of the responsibility to conserve the elephants and other tropical biodiversity from which we benefit.\n",
      "In the past decade we have learned a lot about how important elephants and other large animals are for functioning ecosystems. It is time to apply this knowledge. Berzaghi and colleagues produced evidence linking the behaviour of a single species – feeding disturbances by African forest elephants – to global-scale climatic impacts. As mentioned earlier, the bad news is that we humans are killing elephants and ruining our planet. The good news is that we could synergise efforts and fight climate change by effectively protecting and restoring forest elephant populations and their habitats. The choice seems obvious to me.\n",

      "WEDNESDAY, Dec. 18, 2019 (HealthDay News) -- Diets with a higher glycemic index (GI) may be a risk factor for insomnia in postmenopausal women, according to a study published online Dec. 11 in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.\n",
      "James E. Gangwisch, Ph.D., from Columbia University in New York City, and colleagues investigated the odds of insomnia among 77,860 postmenopausal women participating in the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study at baseline (1994 to 1998), and in 53,069 participants after three years of follow-up (1997 to 2001), based upon associations with GI, glycemic load, other carbohydrate measures (added sugars, starch, total carbohydrate), dietary fiber, and specific carbohydrate-containing foods.\n",
      "The researchers found that in fully adjusted models, higher dietary GI was associated with increasing odds of prevalent (fifth compared with first quintile odds ratio [OR], 1.11) and incident (fifth compared with first quintile OR, 1.16) insomnia. Incident insomnia was associated with higher intakes of dietary added sugars, starch, and nonwhole/refined grains. Higher nonjuice fruit and vegetable intakes were significantly associated with lower odds of incident insomnia, while higher intakes of dietary fiber, whole grains, nonjuice fruit, and vegetables were significantly associated with lower odds of prevalent insomnia.\n",
      "\"By identifying other factors that lead to insomnia, we may find straightforward and low-cost interventions with fewer potential side effects,\" Gangwisch said in a statement.\n",

      "La escritora francesa Marie Darrieussecq escribe en sus memorias de 2023 Sleepless:\n",
      "El mundo se divide entre los que pueden dormir y los que no. \n",
      "El insomnio es una preocupación bien documentada a lo largo de la historia que incluye la dificultad tanto para conciliar el sueño como para permanecer dormido. Suele venir acompañado de angustia y ansiedad durante el día. \n",
      "Hay muchas y variadas razones por las que la gente padece insomnio. Entre ellas se incluyen cambios biológicos a medida que envejecemos o debidos a nuestras hormonas, problemas de salud física o mental, los medicamentos que tomamos, así como la forma y el lugar en que vivimos y trabajamos.\n",
      "La privación del sueño es, literalmente, una forma de tortura. Y el cónsul romano Marco Atilio Régulo es supuestamente la primera persona de la historia que murió de insomnio. Alrededor del año 256 a. e. c. fue entregado a los enemigos de Roma, los cartagineses, que al parecer lo torturaron hasta la muerte. Para ello, le amputaron los párpados y le obligaron a mirar fijamente al Sol.\n",
      "Lo cierto es que la leyenda no se sostiene: no existen relatos fiables de cómo murió Regulus. Pero aunque la tortura de privación de sueño no le matase, se sigue utilizando en muchos países hoy en día.\n",
      "Una de las mejores descripciones tempranas del insomnio  la realizó el clérigo inglés Robert Burton en su libro The Anatomy of Melancholy (1628). \n",
      "Burton sabía que el insomnio era a la vez causa y síntoma de la depresión. También recomendaba evitar comer col, que “causa sueños molestos” y no acostarse inmediatamente después de cenar. \n",
      "En los países no industrializados, el insomnio es bastante raro: sólo lo padece alrededor del 1-2 % de la población. Nada que ver con el Reino Unido moderno, donde las tasas de insomnio estimadas son del 10-48 %, dependiendo del estudio, o con Australia, donde el 14,8% de las personas presentan síntomas que cumplen los criterios del insomnio crónico (de larga duración).\n",
      "En España, algo más de un 20 % de las personas tiene problemas para dormir, un porcentaje inferior al de los vecinos Francia o Portugal, donde roza el 30 %. \n",
      "Para entender las diferencias hay que remontarse al comienzo de la industralización. En el momento en que pasamos de trabajar en el campo a hacerlo mayoritariamente en fábricas, usando máquinas, las cosas que ahora asociamos con el insomnio pasaron a formar parte de la vida de la gente. Entre ellas la iluminación artificial y los relojes. También aumentó el ruido ambiental, se produjeron cambios significativos en la dieta y en la vivienda. Como consecuencia de esta nueva forma de trabajar y de vivir, nuestros hábitos de sueño cambiaron.\n",
      "Más o menos al mismo tiempo, la era de la Ilustración de las nuevas ciencias florecientes a finales del siglo XVIII nos regaló el término “insomnio” y donde hay “insomnio”, tiene que haber “insomnes”. Así que “insomnes” se convirtió en un término de diagnóstico para las personas con problemas de sueño.\n",
      "En el siglo XIX comenzaron a difundirse curas médicas para el insomnio, algunas de ellas probablemente eficaces. En Australia, por ejemplo, se anunciaban los “cigarrillos indios” de Grimault & Co, que contenían cannabis. Fue también en ese siglo cuando surgieron las ideas médicas modernas sobre la ansiedad, que ahora sabemos que puede causar insomnio.\n",
      "Tantos escritores y artistas modernos famosos tuvieron insomnio que ya es casi un cliché. Tanto Victor Hugo como Franz Kafka, Marcel Proust o Ernest Hemingway lucharon contra el insomnio. \n",
      "En el relato corto de Hemingway Now I Lay Me, su narrador, soldado y alter ego, dice:\n",
      "“Yo mismo no quería dormir porque llevaba mucho tiempo viviendo con la certeza de que si alguna vez cerraba los ojos en la oscuridad y me dejaba llevar, mi alma saldría de mi cuerpo”.\n",
      "Tampoco es casualidad que los primeros fármacos barbitúricos se descubrieran en esta época. El barbital, comercializado como Veronal, fue sólo uno de una serie de nuevos fármacos que prometían un sueño fácil a quienes tenían dificultades. \n",
      "Estos fármacos relajaban y adormecían a las personas activando el sistema del ácido gamma-aminobutírico (GABA) del organismo. Esta parte de nuestro sistema nervioso inhibe procesos corporales que, de otro modo, nos mantendrían despiertos. El problema es que, en exceso, pueden frenar demasiado estos procesos: los suicidios y las muertes accidentales por sobredosis de somníferos se hicieron tristemente comunes en las décadas siguientes.\n",
      "Por su parte, la famosa enciclopedia para la vida doméstica Enquire Within Upon Everything ofrecía una cura que sonaba científica para el insomnio:\n",
      "“Las personas nerviosas, aquejadas de vigilia y excitabilidad, suelen tener una fuerte tendencia de la circulación sanguínea hacia el cerebro, con las extremidades frías. La presión de la sangre en el cerebro lo mantiene en un estado estimulado o de vigilia […] levántese y frótese el cuerpo y las extremidades con un cepillo o una toalla, o frótese inteligentemente con las manos para favorecer la circulación, y retire la excesiva cantidad de sangre del cerebro, y se dormirá en unos instantes. Un baño frío, o un baño de esponja y frotar […] ayudará a igualar la circulación y promover el sueño.”\n",
      "Ahora bien, la “higiene del sueño” significa algo diferente a tomar un baño frío. Se refiere al proceso de aquietar el cuerpo y la mente antes de acostarse.\n",
      "En el siglo XXI, la vida occidental ha añadido dos nuevos perturbadores del sueño a la mezcla. Bebemos enormes cantidades de cafeína. También nos acostamos con dispositivos portátiles, con sus luces brillantes y constantes descargas de dopamina que nos estimulan y nos impiden dormir.\n",
      "Nuestros problemas de insomnio no muestran signos de desaparecer. Esto se debe, en parte, a que nuestra economía se organiza cada vez más en torno a un trabajo que priva del sueño. En Estados Unidos, los trabajadores del sector de la producción son los que más probabilidades tienen de padecer trastornos del sueño, posiblemente debido al trabajo por turnos. En el Reino Unido, los jugadores profesionales de fútbol abusan de los somníferos para relajarse tras el subidón de adrenalina de un partido.\n",
      "En Australia, el coste económico de dormir mal se estima en 26 000 millones de dólares australianos al año, principalmente por la pérdida de productividad o los accidentes. Esto indica que hay un buen incentivo económico para abordar el problema.\n",
      "Y si nos guiamos por el mercado mundial del insomnio, éste se ha convertido es un tremendo negocio, cada vez más grande. Se prevé que alcance los 6 300 millones de dólares en 2030, impulsado en gran medida por el aumento de los diagnósticos y las terapias, así como por el uso de ayudas para dormir, como las aplicaciones para dormir.\n",

      "The world is divided into those who can sleep and those who can’t. \n",
      "It’s a big call. But insomnia is a well-recorded preoccupation in history. It includes difficulty falling asleep, or staying asleep, and comes with daytime distress and anxiety. \n",

      "Sleep deprivation is literally a form of torture. Roman consul Marcus Atilius Regulus is allegedly the first person in recorded history to die of insomnia.\n",
      "In about 256 BCE he was handed over to Rome’s enemies, the Carthaginians, who apparently tortured him to death. They did this by amputating his eyelids and forcing him to stare at the Sun.\n",
      "As horrible as this sounds, the legend doesn’t stand up. There are no reliable accounts of how Regulus died. But even though sleep-deprivation torture may not have killed Regulus, it continues to be used in many countries today.\n",
      "One of the best early descriptions of insomnia is by English clergyman Robert Burton in his book The Anatomy of Melancholy (1628). \n",
      "Burton knew insomnia was both a cause and a symptom of depression. He also recommended avoiding eating cabbage, which “causeth troublesome dreams” and not going to bed straight after eating the evening meal. \n",

      "But we need to look at industrialisation – when a country moves from mostly farming to mostly manufacturing using machinery – for clues to the level of insomnia we see in Western nations today.  \n",
      "In countries without industrialisation, insomnia is quite rare. Only around 1-2% of the population will experience it. Compare this with modern United Kingdom, where the estimated insomnia rates are 10-48%, depending on the study. A 2021 report said 14.8% of Australians had symptoms meeting criteria for chronic (long-term) insomnia.\n",
      "As Western countries modernised, things we now associate with insomnia became part of people’s lives. These include artificial lighting and clocks. There was also more ambient noise, and changes in diet and housing. So our sleep habits shifted as a result of this new way of living and working.\n",
      "At around the same time, the Enlightenment era of flourishing new sciences in the late 18th century gave us the term “insomnia” and where there is “insomnia”, there must be “insomniacs”. So “insomniacs” became a diagnostic term for people struggling with sleep.\n",

      "Medical cures for insomnia began to spread – some of them probably effective. \n",
      "For example, in the 19th century Grimault & Co’s “Indian Cigarettes” were advertised in Australia. They contained cannabis.\n",
      "The 19th century was also the birthplace of modern medical ideas about anxiety, which we now know can cause insomnia.\n",
      "Romanian philosopher Emil Cioran (1911-1995) had chronic insomnia. His 1934 book On the Heights of Despair (the title speaks for itself) describes the loneliness and isolation of insomnia – the feeling of being cut off from the rest of humanity. \n",
      "So many famous modern writers and artists had insomnia that it’s now almost a cliche. Victor Hugo, Franz Kafka, Marcel Proust and Ernest Hemingway all struggled with sleeplessness. \n",
      "In Hemingway’s short story Now I Lay Me, his soldier narrator and alter ego says:\n",
      "I myself did not want to sleep because I had been living for a long time with the knowledge that if I ever shut my eyes in the dark and let myself go, my soul would go out of my body.\n",
      "It’s also no coincidence the first barbiturate drugs were discovered in this era. Barbital, marketed as Veronal, was just one of a range of new drugs that promised easy sleep to those who struggled. \n",
      "These drugs made people relaxed and sleepy by switching on the body’s gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) system. This part of our nervous system works to inhibit processes in the body that would otherwise keep us awake. But these drugs can inhibit these processes too much. Suicides and accidental deaths by sleeping pill overdose became sadly common in the following decades.\n",
      "The famous home encyclopedia Enquire Within Upon Everything provided a scientific-sounding cure for insomnia:\n",
      "Nervous persons, who are troubled with wakefulness and excitability, usually have a strong tendency of blood on the brain, with cold extremities. The pressure of the blood on the brain keeps it in a stimulated or wakeful state […] rise and chafe the body and extremities with a brush or towel, or rub smartly with the hands to promote circulation, and withdraw the excessive amount of blood from the brain, and they will fall asleep in a few moments. A cold bath, or a sponge bath and rubbing […] will aid in equalising circulation and promoting sleep.\n",
      "Now, “sleep hygiene” means something different to taking a cold bath. It’s the process of quieting your body and mind before bedtime.\n",

      "In the 21st century, Western living has added two new sleep disturbers to the mix. We drink huge amounts of caffeine. We also go to bed with handheld devices – with their bright lights and constant dopamine hits that stimulate us and stop us sleeping.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our problems with insomnia show no signs of going away. This is partly because our economy is increasingly organised around sleep-depriving work. In the United States, production workers are the most likely to have sleep disorders, possibly because of shift work. In the United Kingdom, professional soccer players are over-using sleeping drugs to help them wind down after the adrenaline rush of a game.\n",
      "In Australia, the financial cost of poor sleep is an estimated A$26 billion a year, mainly through lost productivity or accidents. This means there’s a good financial incentive to address the problem.\n",
      "And if the global insomnia market is anything to go by, insomnia is big business and getting bigger. This is projected to reach US$6.3 billion by 2030, largely driven by increased diagnoses and therapy, as well as the use of sleep aids, such as sleep apps.\n",

      "Desde hace siglos, los estados nutricionales inapropiados han mermado la salud de los humanos provocando enfermedades. Antes el problema era la malnutrición y, ahora, en el polo opuesto, la obesidad. \n",
      "Aunque no existen los alimentos milagrosos, la importancia de llevar una dieta equilibrada es indiscutible. Así se denomina a la que cubre todas las necesidades individuales de los distintos nutrientes: hidratos de carbono, proteínas, lípidos (grasas), minerales, vitaminas y agua. Al mismo tiempo que nos proporciona la energía que precisamos, ni más ni menos. \n",
      "Dentro de ese equilibrio, últimamente hemos\n",
      "identificado ciertos nutrientes y sustancias presentes en los alimentos que funcionan como factores protectores y promotores de la salud. En esta línea, en la Universidad de Valladolid acabamos de publicar el libro 101 alimentos saludables para tener en tu casa. \n",
      "En este artículo selecciono diez de ese centenar de alimentos que deberíamos incluir sin demora en nuestra dieta. \n",
      "1. Tomate\n",
      "De todas las verduras y hortalizas a nuestro alcance, merece la pena destacar al tomate. \n",
      "Pertenece a la familia de las solanáceas, y es muy rico en agua (casi un 95% de su peso), aportando solo 20 calorías por cada 100 gramos. Este aporte tan bajo de calorías se debe a su bajo contenido en hidratos de carbono (3,5 gramos), proteínas (1 gramo) y grasas (0,1 gramos). Aunque lo verdaderamente importante del tomate es su contenido en vitaminas y minerales, sobre todo vitamina C (26 mg por 100 gramos). Tan concentrada está que si comemos 150 gramos de tomate al día es suficiente para cubrir el 100% de las necesidades diarias de esta vitamina para un adulto sano. \n",
      "No podemos dejar de mencionar tampoco al licopeno, un pigmento de la familia de los carotenoides que le da al tomate su color rojo característico (y también a la sandía y al pomelo rosado). El licopeno tiene propiedades antioxidantes. Es más, diferentes estudios han demostrado que al incorporarlo habitualmente en nuestra dieta disminuye el riesgo de desarrollar determinados tumores (próstata, páncreas, pulmón y colon). Por lo que sabemos hasta ahora, se absorbe bastante bien a partir del tomate fresco, pero todavía mejor a través del zumo de tomate o del tomate en salsa. \n",
      "2. Pimiento\n",
      "Como buen vegetal que es, tiene un bajo aporte calórico (20 calorías por 100 gramos), de proteínas y de grasas, aportando fundamentalmente hidratos de carbono y fibra. Este alimento también constituye una fuente importante de vitamina C, sobre todo los pimientos de color rojo. No lo hemos dicho antes, pero la vitamina C es un potente antioxidante que, además, interviene en procesos tan importantes como la formación de colágeno, de glóbulos rojos, de huesos y de dientes. Por si fuera poco, favorece la absorción del hierro de los alimentos y aumenta la resistencia frente a las infecciones. \n",
      "Destaca también en los pimientos la alta concentración de carotenos, entre los que se encuentra la capsantina, otro pigmento antioxidante. Tampoco hay que menospreciar su contenido en provitamina A, que el organismo transforma en vitamina A, un nutriente esencial para la visión, el buen estado de la piel y del pelo o el correcto funcionamiento del sistema inmunológico. Que incluso previene el cáncer de piel.\n",
      "3. Garbanzo\n",
      "Se trata de una leguminosa de la familia de las fabáceas, de amplia difusión en todos los países del Mediterráneo. Su aporte energético supera al de la alubia, alcanzando las 343 kcal por 100 gramos. Se lo debe al elevado contenido en hidratos de carbono (55 gramos por cada 100) y grasas (5 gramos). ¿Y no es mala tanta grasa? En absoluto. Porque son monoinsaturadas y polinsaturadas al 50%, o lo que es lo mismo, cardiosaludables. Si a esto le añadimos que el aporte de colesterol del garbanzo es nulo, esta leguminosa presenta realmente un perfil graso ideal. \n",
      "No acaba ahí la cosa. Además, su aporte proteico es elevado (casi 20 gramos), es rico en potasio y fósforo potasio, y la vitamina más destacada en su composición es el ácido fólico (180 ug).\n",
      "4. Pavo\n",
      "Llamado “gallina de las Indias” por los conquistadores españoles, es oriundo de México de la época de los aztecas, donde se le llamaba “guajalote”. Forma parte de las carnes blancas, que se caracterizan por tener poca grasa y bajo nivel de colesterol. El aporte calórico del pavo es moderado: menos de 130 calorías por cada 100 gramos de muslo y menos de 100 calorías por 100 gramos de pechuga. Óptima por tanto, para personas con alto riesgo cardiovascular.\n",
      "5. Sardina\n",
      "De los pescados nos quedamos con este por ser uno de los pescados grasos por excelencia, que en estos últimos años ha recibido mucha atención por su aporte de ácidos omega-3. No hay que olvidar que el consumo asiduo de omega-3 se relaciona con un efecto beneficioso sobre enfermedades inflamatorias como la artritis reumatoide y las patologías oncológicas. \n",
      "En lo que respecta a las vitaminas, este pescado presenta un aporte interesante de vitaminas liposolubles D, E y A. La vitamina D es muy importante para nuestro metabolismo óseo, y las vitaminas A y E son potentes antioxidantes. También presenta un aporte interesante de vitaminas hidrosolubles del grupo B, con importantes funciones en el aprovechamiento de los nutrientes energéticos. Entre los minerales destaca su aporte en fósforo, tan importante para la formación de los huesos: consumiendo 200 gramos de sardinas ingerimos 100% de las recomendaciones diarias de este mineral. También es importante el aporte de calcio, eso sí, cuando se consume con espinas. \n",
      "6. Arándano\n",
      "Esta fruta es casi un 90% agua y apenas aporta calorías. Su aporte de hidratos de carbono es escaso (6 gramos por cada 100), y el porcentaje de proteínas y grasas prácticamente anecdótico (0,6 gramos). Lo que sí proporciona son cantidades importantes de fibra (5 gramos). Aunque su importancia nutricional  tiene que ver sobre todo con los antioxidantes. Y es que no solo es rica en  vitamina C (22 mg por 100), sino que además contiene abundantes antocianos, unos potentes antioxidantes. Los antocianos le confieren su color característico y, unidos al ácido oxálico o el ácido málico, son responsables de su sabor característico y de sus propiedades antisépticas a la hora de prevenir y tratar las infecciones urinarias.\n",
      "7. Mango\n",
      "Otro alimento que no debería faltar en nuestra despensa es la fruta del árbol Mangifera indica, de la misma familia botánica que el pistacho. Originario de la región del noroeste de la India (a los pies del Himalaya). Desde el punto de vista nutricional, su contenido de agua es elevado (casi un 85%). Aporta 14 gramos de carbohidratos por 100 gramos, y su aporte de grasa es prácticamente nulo. Como curiosidad, decir que aporta también los ácidos tartárico y málico.\n",
      "Además, su abundancia de fibras mejora el tránsito intestinal. En el capítulo de las vitaminas destaca la vitamina C, con 37 mg por 100 gramos, así como las vitamina A y E. Eso lo convierte en otra fuente interesante de antioxidantes, lo que nos ayuda a proteger a nuestro organismo de los fenómenos de envejecimiento, eliminando radicales libres. \n",
      "8. Uva\n",
      "Aunque impopular por su elevado aporte calórico (70 calorías por 100 gramos), es otro alimento interesante. Aporta potasio (350 mg por 100 gramos) y, en menor medida, calcio y magnesio. También ofrecen buena fuente de ácido fólico para las gestantes, y de vitamina B6. Por si fuera poco, aportan antocianos, flavonoides y taninos, responsables de su color, textura y aroma. A ellos se atribuye que esta fruta reduzca el riesgo cardiovascular, disminuyendo la oxidación a nivel de las arterias y mejorando los niveles de colesterol. \n",
      "La piel y las pepitas son ricas en resveratrol, con una importante actividad antioxidante y anticancerosa. \n",
      "9. Miel\n",
      "Sagrada para egipcios y griegos, que la usaban como moneda de cambio para pagar los impuestos, tiene unas cualidades nutricionales y saludables evidentes. Existen múltiples variedades de miel en función de la flor de la que es obtenida por las abejas y del clima de la zona en la que habitan. Hay mieles monoflorales, multiflorales, de la sierra, del desierto, de rocío o de bosque.  \n",
      "Su aporte calórico se sitúa alrededor de 300 calorías por 100 gramos a expensas de los hidratos de carbono, aportando muy pocas proteínas y nada de grasa. Eso explica por qué tradicionalmente se ha usado tópicamente como antiséptico, para favorecer la cicatrización y prevención de infecciones en heridas o quemaduras superficiales: con tanto azúcar destruye físicamente a las bacterias por lisis osmótica. Es decir, hinchándolas de agua, que es atraída por los azucares, hasta que estallan. \n",
      "10. Aceite de oliva \n",
      "Este alimento estrella de la dieta mediterránea no podía faltar en nuestra lista. Gracias a su alto contenido en ácido oleico (omega 9) tiene claras propiedades cardiosaludables. \n",
      "Las evidencias científicas indican que produce en sangre una disminución del colesterol malo (LDL) y aumento del colesterol bueno (HDL). Además, contiene vitamina E a raudales, que protege a las arterias del colesterol ya existente en la sangre, previniendo la arteriosclerosis. \n",
      "Como ventaja adicional, el aceite de oliva virgen extra apenas se infiltra en los alimentos durante la fritura. Es más, ayuda a que se forme una costra alrededor de los alimentos que retiene sus nutrientes, por lo que es el mejor aceite para freír. \n",
      "En la última década, los trabajos publicados a raíz del estudio PREDIMED (acrónimo de efectos de la dieta mediterránea en la prevención primaria de la enfermedad cardiovascular) han demostrado que el consumo regular de aceite de oliva disminuye los eventos cardiovasculares, las fracturas secundarias a osteoporosis y el desarrollo de algunos tumores, como el cáncer de mama. Incluso se asocia a un aumento de la longevidad.\n",
      "Aunque ojo, porque eso no implica que debamos consumirlo sin limites. Al fin y al cabo, es un alimento graso que por tanto posee un alto valor calórico, aportando casi 900 calorías por 100 ml.\n",
      "\n",
      "----------------------------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "Durante los meses fríos del invierno es habitual encadenar infecciones, generalmente respiratorias, una tras otra, y es inevitable hacernos la pregunta de si tendremos un sistema inmunitario potente o si, por el contrario, tanta infección es consecuencia de su mal funcionamiento. \n",
      "Puede que sí o puede que no. No hay una respuesta única y podemos encontrarnos ante varias explicaciones a tanta infección.\n",
      "Si un patógeno encuentra las condiciones idóneas para su supervivencia y propagación, es evidente que va a tener mayor facilidad para infectarnos. La temperatura y la humedad contribuyen notablemente a la transmisión, aunque no de igual manera para todos los patógenos. \n",
      "Así, si un virus se transmite por gotículas (que son de tamaño grande, pesadas y con tendencia a caer pronto al suelo), una elevada humedad evitará que se deshidraten, sean por tanto más pesadas y caigan pronto al suelo, teniendo menos oportunidades para infectarnos. Pero como, aunque parezca lo contrario,  el aire es más seco en invierno, estas gotículas se deshidratarán pronto, pesarán menos y permanecerán más tiempo en el aire, favoreciendo así la infección. \n",
      "A esto se le suma que las temperaturas elevadas inhiben la capacidad de transmisión de algunos virus, con independencia de la humedad. Sin olvidar que en los meses fríos pasamos más tiempo en interiores, muchas veces con mala renovación del aire, muy expuestos por lo tanto a la infección por aerosoles. Argumentos de sobra para entender por qué muchas enfermedades respiratorias son más frecuentes en invierno. \n",
      "Y todo lo anterior no tiene nada que ver con un sistema inmunitario que no funciona bien, sino con una elevada capacidad de infección del patógeno.\n",
      "Las inmunodeficiencias son enfermedades que se caracterizan por la incapacidad del sistema inmunitario para montar una respuesta eficaz frente a los antígenos. Como consecuencia, los pacientes sufren frecuentes infecciones. Pueden ser de nacimiento (inmunodeficiencias primarias, generalmente graves) o bien adquiridas (inmunodeficiencias secundarias). \n",
      "Entre estas últimas, la más frecuente y grave ha sido el SIDA (síndrome de inmunodeficiencia adquirida), producido por la infección con el  VIH, con las consecuencias por todos conocidas. Pero no es la única. Ciertos tratamientos médicos, como es el caso de la quimioterapia, producen una depresión importante del sistema inmunitario. También es el caso de las personas trasplantadas, que deben tomar inmunosupresores de por vida para evitar el rechazo, o de muchos pacientes con enfermedades autoinmunes, que también deben seguir este tipo de tratamientos. \n",
      "Además, el sistema inmunitario también se ve alterado con el paso de los años, en un proceso llamado inmunosenescencia. Debido a ello, las personas mayores no son capaces de montar respuestas inmunitarias potentes, y por ello son susceptibles a sufrir infecciones que habitualmente no causan patología grave en personas adultas. \n",
      "Un ejemplo de las consecuencias que tiene este proceso de inmunosenescencia y de las respuestas alteradas en mayores lo hemos visto en la COVID-19, en la que el principal factor de riesgo de mortalidad era la edad avanzada.\n",
      "Incluso si nuestro sistema inmunitario es robusto, puede que unos días después de sufrir una infección nos venga otra (superinfección). No debe sorprendernos. Desde hace muchos años sabemos que sufrir una enfermedad viral aumenta la probabilidad de sufrir otra producida por bacterias. \n",
      "Esto lo hemos visto, por ejemplo, en las sucesivas epidemias de gripe en la que muchas muertes fueron debidas a complicaciones por neumonías bacterianas, incluyendo la llamada gripe española de 1918 que causó unos 50 millones de fallecimientos. \n",
      "¿Pero por qué? La explicación no ha empezado a ser entendida hasta hace muy poco. Por un lado, está relacionado con el hecho de que los virus pueden facilitar directamente la adhesión de ciertas bacterias a los epitelios respiratorios, a través de la inducción de moléculas de adhesión o de receptores que favorecen esa unión. Por otra parte, el virus respiratorio sincitial, que afecta especialmente a los niños, suele unirse a bacterias que provocan neumonía, y les hace aumentar su capacidad de infección. \n",
      "Hay otro grupo de causas relacionado con los daños que ciertos virus causan en las estructuras respiratorias. Por ejemplo, el virus de la gripe A causa múltiples daños en los epitelios respiratorios que son aprovechados por las bacterias para infectarnos con mayor eficacia. \n",
      "Y no acaba ahí la cosa. La infección en sí misma puede aumentar la disponibilidad de nutrientes para otros microbios. ¿Cómo? Muy sencillo: al modificar las estructuras epiteliales libera elementos como carbono, nitrógeno o hierro, necesarios para el crecimiento de muchas bacterias. \n",
      "Que una infección lleve a otra tiene que ver también con las alteraciones que provoca el virus en el sistema inmunitario. Por ejemplo, tras la infección por gripe se producen mediadores antiinflamatorios durante semanas, además de reducir la capacidad de las células innatas para eliminar bacterias. El virus respiratorio sincitial, por su parte, inhibe la interacción entre las células presentadoras de antígeno y las respondedoras, lo que deja al sistema inmunitario vulnerable ante nuevos ataques. La infección por el virus del sarampión disminuye sustancialmente la memoria inmunológica, con lo que perdemos la protección frente a infecciones pasadas. \n",
      "Como colofón, también hay infecciones causadas por la alteración de la microbiota respiratoria, es decir, el conjunto de bacterias no patógenas que residen en nuestras mucosas y que son esenciales para mantenerlas sanas teniendo, además, un efecto beneficioso sobre nuestro organismo. Estas bacterias hacen de escudo al ocupar toda la mucosa, evitando la infección por patógenos. Además, modulan la respuesta inmunitaria innata y la producción de citocinas antivirales. Cuando algo las destruye o las desequilibra, nos volvemos presa fácil de la infección por patógenos. \n",
      "La relación entre esta microbiota, respiratoria e intestinal y una salud adecuada es actualmente un excitante campo científico.\n",

      "Pour faire face à la pandémie de Covid-19 causée par le coronavirus émergent SARS-CoV-2, deux pistes principales ont été explorées : celle des traitements antiviraux, et celle des vaccins. Alors que l’essai clinique Solidarity, monté par l’OMS pour aider à trouver un traitement efficace contre la Covid-19, n’a pas abouti, trois vaccins contre le SARS-CoV-2 ont été développés durant l’année 2020 : BNT162b2 (BioNTech/Pfizer), mRNA-1273 (Moderna), ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (Oxford/AstraZeneca).\n",
      "En quelques mois, ils ont pu être testés chez l’animal et validés par des essais cliniques chez l’être humain, ce qui constitue un record absolu dans l’histoire de la vaccination moderne. Auparavant, on considérait qu’il fallait en moyenne 8 ans pour disposer d’un vaccin efficace et sûr.\n",
      "Comment s’explique ce succès ? Annonce-t-il une nouvelle révolution vaccinale, qui permettrait de développer des vaccins contre n’importe quel agent pathogène ? La réalité est plus nuancée.\n",
      "L’Organisation mondiale de la santé (OMS) estime que la vaccination prévient à elle seule chaque année environ 3 millions de décès dans le monde. C’est, avec l’accès à l’eau potable, la mesure de santé publique qui a le plus grand impact en termes de réduction de la mortalité.\n",
      "Vaccin atténué, inactivé, sous-unitaire adjuvanté, vecteur viral, ARN… Face à l’urgence sanitaire due à la propagation rapide du SARS-CoV-2, toutes les technologies vaccinales disponibles ont été utilisées sans a priori pour tenter de mettre au point un vaccin, l’objectif étant de réduire le risque d’échec. Toutes les étapes de développement et de validation se sont également enchaînées, sans la moindre pause.\n",
      "Cette stratégie du « tout en même temps », financièrement très coûteuse et risquée, n’a été possible que grâce à un investissement massif de la part des États. Le gouvernement américain a investi jusqu’à ce jour, via l’Operation Warp Speed, plus de 18 milliards de dollars pour financer le développement des vaccins contre la Covid-19. Un chiffre impressionnant, mais qui reste négligeable face au coût estimé de l’épidémie de Covid-19 pour ce pays. Dans l’hypothèse où elle serait maîtrisée fin 2021, les experts estiment elle aura alors coûté aux États-Unis entre 3 000 et 16 000 milliards de dollars.\n",
      "Cet investissement massif ne sera pas uniquement profitable à la gestion de la pandémie de SARS-CoV-2. Il a notamment permis de valider l’usage chez l’humain de la technologie des vaccins à ARN, qui dispose de plusieurs avantages majeurs. Cette technologie permet en effet de développer directement un vaccin à partir de la séquence génétique de l’agent pathogène, sans passer par sa culture ou la production par génie génétique de ses protéines, ce qui représente un gain de temps considérable.\n",
      "Chez la souris, cette technologie a rendu possible le développement en quelques mois de vaccins protecteurs contre des virus tels que le virus Influenza H1N1 ou le virus Ebola. Elle permet d’envisager de produire des candidats vaccins pour faire face localement à des agents infectieux émergents avant qu’ils ne se propagent et ne constituent un risque de pandémie.\n",
      "Enfin, elle ouvre également la voie à des vaccins personnalisés contre les tumeurs ou les maladies autoimmunes. Ces vaccins thérapeutiques, produits spécifiquement pour un seul individu, révolutionneraient l’immunothérapie.\n",
      "Cette réussite et ces espoirs ne doivent cependant pas nous faire oublier qu’il existe plus de 1400 agents pathogènes infectant l’humain et qu’il en émerge de nouveaux chaque année. Plus d’un siècle s’est écoulé depuis la découverte de la vaccination par Louis Pasteur, mais dans ce laps de temps, nous n’avons été capables de produire des vaccins efficaces que contre moins d’une trentaine de maladies infectieuses.\n",
      "Bien sûr, nous n’avons pas besoin de vaccins contre tous les pathogènes. Beaucoup ne causent que des pathologies bénignes et de nombreuses infections sont évitables par des mesures prophylactiques simples. Néanmoins, nous essuyons des échecs répétés depuis des décennies face à plusieurs pathogènes représentant des priorités de santé publique.\n",
      "Les causes de ces échecs sont multiples. L’une d’entre elles repose sur le modèle de financement des vaccins. Complexe et laborieux, il implique souvent de nombreux partenariats public-privé. Or, le marché potentiel pour certains vaccins peut être jugé insuffisant par les investisseurs privés. Par exemple, quand le pathogène n’infecte qu’un nombre réduit d’individus ou présente une distribution géographique limitée.\n",
      "Mais l’argent ne fait pas tout : des investissements considérables ont été réalisés pour lutter contre le virus de l’immunodéficience humaine (VIH) responsable du Sida, la bactérie Mycobacterium tuberculosis (aussi connue sous l’appellation « bacille de Koch »), responsable de la tuberculose ou les parasites protozoaires Plasmodium (cause du paludisme, ou malaria), responsable à eux trois de plus de 2,5 millions de morts par an. Ces investissements n’ont pourtant toujours pas permis le développement de vaccins présentant une efficacité satisfaisante. Premier espoir, un vaccin contre le paludisme, le vaccin RTS,S/AS01 (Mosquirix, GSK), a montré une protection significative mais partielle chez les jeunes enfants en 2015.\n",
      "Pourquoi de telles difficultés, même lorsque les moyens alloués à la recherche de nouveaux vaccins sont considérables ? Les nouvelles technologies vaccinales, comme les vaccins ARN, pourront-elles changer cette situation ?\n",
      "Suite à la détection d’un agent pathogène, le système immunitaire riposte rapidement par une réponse innée, reposant notamment sur les cellules des muqueuses et les macrophages. Pour infecter un hôte, un pathogène doit donc être capable, à minima, d’échapper partiellement à cette réponse stéréotypée, qui n’est pas spécifique d’un envahisseur donné. Le développement d’une réponse adaptative, spécifique du pathogène et médiée par les lymphocytes, permet le plus souvent au système immunitaire d’éliminer l’agent infectieux et d’acquérir une immunité de longue durée contre celui-ci.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Le principe de la vaccination est de copier cette immunité adaptative, qui se développe suite à une infection naturelle. Tous les vaccins contiennent donc des informations sur la structure de l’agent pathogène, ce que l’on nomme les « antigènes » (terme désignant tout élément étranger à l’organisme capable de déclencher une réponse immunitaire). Selon le type de vaccin, les antigènes peuvent être présents sous la forme, par exemple, de protéines du virus (vaccin sous-unitaire adjuvanté) ou de matériel génétique (vaccin vectorisé, vaccin ARN) viral. Ils sont indispensables pour induire le développement des populations lymphocytaires spécifiques de mémoire qui vont permettre de contrôler et d’éliminer le pathogène.\n",
      "Lorsque l’on souhaite développer un vaccin contre un agent pathogène, l’identification des antigènes vaccinaux est donc considérée comme un pré-requis. Le génome de la majorité des virus ne comprend que quelques dizaines, voir quelques centaines de gènes. Il est donc assez aisé d’identifier ceux correspondant aux antigènes les plus exposés au système immunitaire, comme la protéine « spike » du SARS-CoV-2.\n",
      "Chez les bactéries et les protozoaires, les choses sont différentes : leur génome comporte plusieurs milliers de gènes. Et celui de certains vers parasites des dizaines de milliers. Par conséquent, identifier les antigènes vaccinaux pour ces pathogènes hautement complexes peut nécessiter un travail de très longue haleine.\n",
      "De plus, certains pathogènes présentent des cycles de vie complexes au sein de leur hôte (l’organisme qu’ils infectent). Ils peuvent se transformer en cours d’infection. Ces modifications peuvent s’accompagner de l’expression d’antigènes différents à chaque étape du cycle. Cela complique encore l’identification des antigènes les plus appropriés pour mettre au point un vaccin efficace. \n",
      "C’est par exemple le cas des protozoaires Plasmodium, agents du paludisme, dont une partie du cycle de vie se déroule chez le moustique anophèle et l’autre chez l’être humain. Le moustique vecteur infecte l’humain avec une première forme du parasite, laquelle va se multiplier dans les cellules du foie et se transformer en une seconde forme. Celle-ci va infecter les globules rouges et s’y multiplier sous une troisième forme. Chacune de ces forme présente des antigènes distincts.\n",
      "Au-delà de ces difficultés à identifier les antigènes vaccinaux, de nombreux agents pathogènes ont également acquis au cours de l’évolution des mécanismes d’échappement à la réponse immunitaire adaptative. Ces mécanismes leur permettent de persister dans l’hôte durant de longues périodes, parfois durant toute la vie de celui-ci, ce qui augmente leurs chances de transmission. Ce sont ces mécanismes d’échappement, qui reposent principalement sur la variation antigénique (les antigènes se modifient au fil du temps, ce qui contrecarre le développement d’une immunité adaptative), la furtivité ou la neutralisation du système immunitaire, qui rendent parfois cauchemardesque le développement d’un vaccin.\n",
      "Le génome des virus à ARN évolue à une vitesse extrêmement rapide. En effet, lorsque ces virus se multiplient et recopient leur matériel génétique, ils commettent de nombreuses erreurs, ce qui mène à l’émergence d’une large population de variants. Cette grande diversité peut rendre impossible l’identification d’antigènes vaccinaux qui permettraient de cibler l’ensemble de la population.\n",
      "Le cas du virus influenza responsable de la grippe est à ce titre emblématique. Son génome peut évoluer graduellement non seulement par mutations (on appelle ce phénomène « dérive antigénique »), mais également par l’échange de gènes entiers avec d’autres virus de la même espèce (réassortiment). Les vaccins contre la grippe ne peuvent cibler tous ces antigènes ; ils ne contiennent que les plus courants. De ce fait, ils ne protègent pas contre tous les variants du virus et leur composition doit être actualisée chaque année pour tenir compte des antigènes présents sur les virus majoritairement en circulation.\n",
      "Certains pathogènes sont même capables de varier les antigènes les plus exposés à leur surface à une vitesse telle qu’ils génèrent une importante population de variants au sein même de l’hôte infecté. C’est par exemple le cas de la bactérie Helicobacter pylori, qui provoque des ulcères gastro-duodénaux, ou du protozoaireTrypanosoma brucei, l’agent de la maladie du sommeil. Cette variabilité permanente empêche le système immunitaire adaptatif de cibler l’ensemble de la population des envahisseurs, et donc de les neutraliser.\n",
      "D’autres pathogènes peuvent se rendre quasiment invisibles pour le système immunitaire en neutralisant directement ses voies d’activation ou en modifiant les cellules de l’hôte pour se construire des réservoirs cellulaires les isolant de la réponse immunitaire. Les virus de la famille Herpesviridae, comme le cytomégalovirus, bloquent la présentation de leurs antigènes au système immunitaire. La bactérie Mycobacterium tuberculosis perturbe les mécanismes microbicides et modifie à son avantage le métabolisme des macrophages qu’elle infecte.\n",
      "La suppression partielle ou totale du système immunitaire, qui se traduit par un affaiblissement du système immunitaire de l’hôte (immunodépression), constitue une autre stratégie efficace assurant la persistance de l’agent pathogène. Elle est susceptible d’invalider l’ensemble des stratégies vaccinales. Le virus de la rougeole réduit la diversité du répertoire des anticorps de son hôte et abolit la mémoire immunitaire protectrice acquise contre d’autres pathogènes, provoquant une « amnésie immunitaire ». L’infection par les protozoaires Plasmodium induit quant à elle la production d’immunosuppresseurs, des molécules qui affectent l’ensemble du système immunitaire et réduisent durablement la capacité de l’hôte à réagir aux infections et à développer une immunité suite à une vaccination.\n",
      "Et rien n’interdit à certains pathogènes de cumuler de nombreux mécanismes d’échappement. Le VIH, par exemple, présente un taux de mutation très élevé source de nombreux variants, est capable de s’intégrer pour une longue durée au génome des cellules de son hôte, ce qui le rend indétectable, et détruit les lymphocytes T CD4, ce qui cause à terme une immunodépression profonde et irréversible. Cette combinaison de mécanismes d’échappement défie jusqu’à présent toutes les stratégies vaccinales.\n",
      "Certes, les techniques de vaccination ont considérablement progressé ces dernières décennies, grâce notamment à une meilleure compréhension du système immunitaire et aux progrès des techniques de biologie moléculaire. Malgré tout, il faut souligner que nous avons eu la « chance » d’être confronté, avec le coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, à un agent pathogène relativement « simple ».\n",
      "En effet, si les nouvelles plates-formes vaccinales permettent de produire rapidement des vaccins à partir de la séquence génétique d’un agent pathogène, il est peu probable que cette approche empirique suffise à faire face à des micro-organismes complexes, ou disposant de mécanismes d’échappement à la réponse immunitaire adaptative.\n",
      "Pour contrer des pathogènes de ce type, il restera sans doute nécessaire de caractériser finement leur cycle de multiplication ainsi que leurs interactions avec le système immunitaire de l’hôte, pour révéler le défaut de leur cuirasse.\n",
      "Ce qui peut s’avérer laborieux et implique le financement d’une recherche fondamentale sans a priori sur le très long terme, ainsi qu’une coopération étroite entre immunologistes et microbiologistes.\n",
      "Il faut également garder à l’esprit que disposer d’un vaccin efficace ne dispense pas de surveiller l’évolution génomique du pathogène concerné. En effet, la relation entre un pathogène et son hôte suit une dynamique de type Reine Rouge : les pathogènes évoluent sans cesse en réponse aux pressions de sélection de leur hôte, comme le montrent l’acquisition de résistances aux antibiotiques, aux antiviraux et à certains vaccins.\n",
      "De nombreuses mutations du SARS-CoV-2 ont déjà été documentées. La pression de sélection engendrée par les vaccins Covid-19 sélectionnera-t-elle des variants capables d’échapper à ceux-ci ? L’avenir nous le dira. Une chose est sûre, surveiller et comprendre les interactions entre le pathogène et son hôte est important pour anticiper ces problèmes potentiels.\n",
      "Enfin, un vaccin n’est efficace que si l’on s’en sert. Or, vacciner la population mondiale est un défi, non seulement logistique, en raison de la médiocrité des infrastructures dans de nombreuses régions, mais aussi parce que le niveau d’hésitation vaccinale est élevé. Au point que l’hésitation vaccinale a été identifiée par l’OMS en 2019 comme l’une des 10 principales menaces sur la santé mondiale.\n",

      "World Immunisation Week is celebrated in the last week of April every year. The aim is to recognise efforts to develop new vaccines and increase vaccination coverage worldwide. The World Health Organisation (WHO) also uses the week to galvanise national and international communities to keep pushing for more: greater demand for vaccines, better access, equity and higher coverage.\n",
      "Vaccines are some of the most equitable and cost-effective health interventions available. As global attention is captured by the COVID-19 pandemic, the campaign to champion all vaccines matters now more than ever.\n",
      "The world before vaccination was a very different place. On the African continent, before a yellow fever vaccine was developed and routinely delivered (as recommended by the WHO in 1988), epidemics occurred every three to 10 years. Up to a quarter of those showing symptoms would get severe disease and among those with severe disease, half would die. Outbreaks still occur in at-risk areas where vaccination services have broken down. But if the vaccine is available, 99% of people who get it are protected within 30 days of the injection and will survive.\n",
      "Similarly with measles, between 2000 and 2018 the vaccination is estimated to have prevented 23 million deaths worldwide. In the 1960s, before widespread vaccination, measles epidemics used to occur every two or three years, not only causing millions of deaths, usually in children, but also long-term disabilities. Measles can attack every organ in the body, and even after recovering from the illness, children can be left blind or deaf, with detrimental effects on their immune systems. \n",
      "There have been substantial gains in measles prevention. But there were still 140,000 measles deaths worldwide in 2018 due to pockets of unvaccinated children transmitting the disease. In the African region alone, the WHO estimates there were 1.7 million cases of illness and 50,000 deaths in 2018 . \n",
      "While calling for a COVID-19 vaccine we must remember to ensure that the highly effective vaccines in our existing armoury, like the one for measles, continue to be made available for all who need them. COVID-19 provides a stark reminder of what a world without vaccines would look like.\n",
      "If vaccines are so effective, why don’t we have them for all diseases?\n",
      "HIV and malaria are “hard hitters” on the African continent and have been for decades, so why are there still no vaccines available? \n",
      "A large part of the challenge boils down to how rapidly these germs can change their identity. Vaccines aim to simulate a natural infection, so that when a true infection comes along, your body can recognise the germ quickly and launch the correct response to disarm it. They are, in that way, one of the most “natural” medical interventions you could think of. Essentially they just prepare your own immune system to react more effectively than it would if coming into contact with the germ for the very first time.\n",
      "The route to developing an effective vaccine, therefore, depends on the nature of the germ itself, how your natural immune system responds to it and the safety of different possible types of vaccine material. Unfortunately, both malaria and HIV are highly complex organisms that can rapidly change the way they “look” to your immune system. This makes it hard to make a vaccine, as the organism itself is constantly changing and has inbuilt ways to evade recognition by your immune system.\n",
      "The safety of potential vaccines is also crucial. Research moves sequentially from “test-tubes” to animals and, if it meets all the criteria indicating that it is safe, then the trials move to include a small number of healthy adults. Gradually, the number and diversity of those included in trials is expanded, until enough safety and efficacy data are accrued to pass it through to the next stage of development. \n",
      "There is a huge amount of ongoing research to identify possible “candidate” vaccines for both HIV and malaria (and COVID-19). A few malaria vaccine candidates have looked promising and there is a large scale implementation trial of the RTSS malaria vaccine to demonstrate effectiveness; researchers are optimistic. Despite testing a large number of HIV vaccine candidates in the past few decades, they have failed to demonstrate efficacy, and the search continues. \n",
      "But the frustration from decades of failed attempts should not reduce the rigour of the research needed. The vaccine development process has to be long enough to ensure the end product is safe. Continued focus on developing new vaccines is needed, alongside patience and political will to get them to the populations that need them most when they do become available.\n",
      "“Getting vaccines to the populations that need them most” encompasses a range of problems. The WHO estimates that in 2018, 20 million children remained unvaccinated or under-vaccinated. That is, they had not completed the full course of recommended vaccinations by the time they reached one year of age. That is one in every seven infants worldwide. \n",
      "This statistic hides considerable complexity. The number varies by vaccine, across countries and within countries.\n",
      "Leaving a proportion of the population under-vaccinated doesn’t just affect those individuals, it reduces herd protection. Herd protection is the effect achieved by vaccinating most people in the “herd” and therefore reducing transmission of the infection to such an extent that the remainder don’t come into contact with it. This protects vulnerable people who cannot be vaccinated because they are too young or have certain health conditions. \n",
      "Pockets of under-vaccinated people put themselves and others at risk as they act as reservoirs for transmission of the infection.\n",
      "Vaccine hesitancy or “anti-vax” sentiment has become a growing issue, to the extent that the WHO considered it one of the top 10 threats to global health in 2019. It is still relatively rare in Africa, but it has arisen recently in populations more sceptical of health authorities and for whom the memories of uncontrolled infection have disappeared. \n",
      "It must be guarded against, especially in the uncertain times of COVID-19. A global pandemic like this one threatens to reverse the victories that are won every day over vaccine-preventable diseases in low-income settings, including gains towards polio eradication. \n",
      "The pandemic reduces the staff and resources available to continue routine immunisation services as resources are redirected to COVID-19 wards. Uncertainty over whether services are continuing as many workplaces are temporarily shut down, together with reduced transport options, makes it harder for parents to access care. \n",
      "Fear of contracting the virus in transit or while at the health facility may additionally prevent parents from bringing children to the health centre. If the uptake of vaccines does drop, outbreaks of vaccine preventable diseases such as bacterial meningitis and pneumonia, measles, rotavirus diarrhoea and others will cause even higher rates of death when patients present to a health system that is already straining under the weight of COVID. \n",
      "Now more than ever, routine vaccination must continue. The WHO has released guidelines on maintaining routine immunisation services during the COVID-19 pandemic. While everyone has their eyes on the coronavirus pandemic, it is vitally important that national immunisation programmes, front line health workers and parents find a way to sustain the routine immunisation system and continue to save millions of children’s lives.\n",

      "The measles virus has been a part of human life for thousands of years. A recent study suggests that it appeared about 4,000 years ago, originating from a virus affecting livestock. That was also the time when cities were reaching population sizes above 250,000 – enough to keep the virus spreading even though people who have had measles don’t ever get it again.\n",
      "As recently as the mid-20th century, before the development of a vaccine, nearly every person could expect to be infected with the measles virus in their lifetime. The introduction of a vaccine in the mid-1960s has dramatically cut the incidence of measles. Fewer than seven million cases were estimated in 2017. But those improvements have not been evenly spread. The incidence of measles is concentrated in low-income countries. And the risk of death or severe complications is disproportionately high in marginalised populations with poor access to health services. \n",
      "The risk of mortality due to measles infection is 5-times higher in low- compared to high-income countries and can be greater than 10% when outbreaks overwhelm health systems. There were over 1,000 measles deaths in Madagascar in 2019 and there have been over 6,000 deaths so far in an outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The long-term effects of these outbreaks on immunity to other diseases has yet to be seen, and may be substantial.\n",

      "Measles is very easily transmitted from person to person in the droplets created when an infected person coughs or sneezes. These droplets can stay in the air for hours.\n",
      "The disease often begins with a runny nose, runny eyes and a cough, followed by a rash. The virus infects cells throughout the body, but specifically kills cells of the immune system which the body uses to fight infection. This makes it harder to fight off common infections that cause pneumonia or diarrhoea. During and just after measles infection, individuals are more likely to get very ill or even die from secondary infections that would otherwise be relatively harmless. \n",
      "Recent research has uncovered a new mechanism suggesting that this effect may persist for over a year. This new research suggests that measles infection not only weakens the immune system, but in some cases resets it. It can make people susceptible again to infections they were previously immune to. In rare cases, measles infection can lead to neurological complications that result in deafness or blindness.\n",
      "Vaccination prior to exposure remains the single most effective way to prevent measles disease. The vaccine is a weakened virus which triggers strong immunity to the full-strength virus without causing disease. A successful vaccination against measles in childhood should provide lifetime protection. Two doses are recommended for each child to ensure at least one is successful.\n",
      "The more similar the structure of the vaccine is to the virus in its natural state, the stronger the protection of the vaccine. The measles vaccine is very similar and conveys strong protection. But this similarity is the vaccine’s greatest weakness as it must be kept in a very narrow temperature regime – not too cold, not too warm – to remain effective. The supply chains to get the vaccine from production to health clinics must have very specific refrigeration equipment throughout. This has been difficult in places where electrification is limited. These communities may only receive effective vaccines during large campaigns every few years, leaving some children unprotected.\n",
      "The combination of rapid transmission and strong immunity after infection means that measles disease commonly occurs in dramatic outbreaks. Even in places where measles is present year-round, there tends to be large differences between the high and low seasons. It can flare up in periods of increased contact among people, for example due to school or economic cycles. A lot of people will be infected at the same time, and then be immune. After an outbreak, there aren’t many people who are still able to get infected – until more children are born. If vaccination coverage is high enough, it can prevent transmission altogether and eliminate measles, as has been achieved in the Americas.\n",
      "The impact of measles has changed dramatically over the last half century. What was once a near certain infection for all people has become a distinctly inequitable health risk. Wealthy countries can maintain high rates of vaccination and reduce the risk of exposure. Even within low-income countries where measles is both endemic and common, the risk falls disproportionately on populations that are difficult to reach with effective vaccination. They may be far from vaccination services or otherwise marginalised and unable to access vaccination. Political and military conflict frequently add to the problem. \n",
      "An analysis prior to the Madagascar outbreak highlighted that declining vaccination coverage (perhaps due to the political crisis in 2009) and failure of supplementary immunisation activities to reach adolescents who had missed routine childhood doses may have increased the outbreak risk. The magnitude of the ongoing outbreak in the DRC reflects long-term, systemic challenges of achieving high vaccination coverage in a large, mainly rural population. The Ebola outbreak in the northeast has placed additional burdens on the routine health system and led to additional declines in vaccination coverage.\n",

      "La misma fuente cita que casi el 85% de estos nuevos casos corresponde a personas que no estaban correctamente vacunadas, nueve de los cuales eran personal sanitario. Veinticinco de ellos, que no estaban vacunados, necesitaron ingreso sanitario. De ahí la importancia de continuar vacunándose, apostillan.\n",
      "Si tuviésemos que resumir brevemente los principios en los que se sostiene la vacunación, podríamos decir que las vacunas estimulan a nuestro sistema inmune para que acumule mecanismos contra agentes que nos provocan enfermedades. De esta forma, aprendemos cómo combatir de forma muy eficiente y rápida organismos infecciosos invasores antes de que causen daño. \n",
      "Pero ¿cómo funcionan exactamente las vacunas y por qué representan nuestra mejor arma contra las enfermedades? Pues bien, según la interesante y muy didáctica guía The History of Vaccines publicada por el Colegio de Médicos de Filadelfia, la sociedad profesional más antigua de Estados Unidos de Norteamérica, la vacuna es como un impostor de un patógeno. \n",
      "Al hacerse pasar como un virus o bacteria, la vacuna prepara las defensas para que respondan adecuadamente si en un futuro nos volvemos a encontrar con esa misma entidad patogénica. Generalmente los agentes infecciosos están cubiertos con moléculas que se llaman antígenos, que son los que específicamente activan la respuesta inmunológica. \n",
      "Cuando un antígeno es presentado a nuestro sistema de defensa, un tipo muy específico de célula denominada célula B de memoria se activa diferenciándose a célula B plasmática que produce anticuerpos contra ese antígeno en particular. \n",
      "Luego estos anticuerpos atacan fijándose a la superficie del patógeno a través de su antígeno específico. Tras la unión, el anticuerpo impide la penetración del patógeno a su célula diana, o lo marca como si se tratará de una banderola que iniciará una respuesta de eliminación activa por parte de otras células inmunológicas.\n",
      "Analicemos el caso de la gripe. Cada vez que se identifica una nueva cepa del virus, con frecuencia anualmente, deben transcurrir entre cinco y seis meses para que estén listos los primeros lotes de la vacuna aprobada. \n",
      "Brevemente, y según una nota informativa oficial de la OMS sobre fabricación de la vacuna gripal publicada en agosto de 2009, primero el virus debe adaptarse para que se vuelva menos peligroso y aumente su capacidad de multiplicarse en huevos de gallina (el método de producción que emplean casi todos los fabricantes de vacunas). Luego se mezcla con una cepa estandarizada de virus de laboratorio y se deja que se multipliquen juntos. \n",
      "Posteriormente, el virus híbrido o vacunal que se obtiene tiene que someterse a pruebas para comprobar que produce los antígenos exteriores y que es totalmente inocuo para la salud. \n",
      "Terminada esta etapa, que tarda más o menos otras tres semanas, la OMS distribuye la cepa de virus vacunal entre los fabricantes oficiales para su multiplicación mediante inyección en huevos de gallina de entre 9 y 12 días de fecundación. Los huevos inyectados se incuban durante dos o tres días para favorecer la multiplicación vírica. Después se destruyen con sustancias químicas con el objetivo de producir cientos de millares de litros del antígeno vírico purificado que constituye el ingrediente activo de la vacuna. \n",
      "Generalmente se producen tantos lotes como sea necesario para obtener la cantidad imprescindible de vacuna. En determinados países, cada nueva vacuna antigripal debe someterse a prueba en algunas personas para demostrar que funciona según lo previsto. Para ello hacen falta cuatro semanas más de producción como mínimo. En otros países no  es preciso porque se han efectuado muchos ensayos clínicos con las vacunas anuales similares y se da por sentado que la nueva vacuna (o, mejor dicho, lote de vacuna) funcionará de manera semejante.\n",
      "Desde el descubrimiento de la vacunación han existido grupos en contra de esta práctica más o menos organizados que han llevado a la creación de un movimiento antivacunas a nivel global. Este movimiento es promovido por un número creciente de personas escépticas que se oponen fervientemente a vacunar, tanto a sus hijos como a sus mascotas, por un miedo injustificado a que las vacunas provoquen enfermedades o efectos secundarios indeseados. \n",
      "Y esto, señores míos, es inaudito y cuánto menos ridículo. Nos enfrentamos a una realidad chocante y en gran medida absurda que parece seguir muy arraigada. Lo peor es que se fundamenta en polémicos artículos como el publicado en 1998 por un prometedor investigador llamado Andrew Wakefield en la prestigiosa revista científica The Lancet, en el que se establecía un hipotético vínculo entre la vacuna de la triple vírica y el autismo. Con datos de solo 12 niños.\n",
      "En contra de este único estudio, muchos otros (uno de ellos con más de 650.000 niños daneses desde 1999 hasta el 31 de diciembre de 2010, con seguimiento desde el año de edad y hasta el 31 de agosto de 2013) demuestran con evidencias muchísimo más sólidas que la vacuna de la rubeola, la parotiditis y el sarampión –más conocida como triple vírica*– no provoca autismo. En consecuencia, el artículo de la discordia de Wakefield fue retractado por haber publicado resultados “falsificados” en febrero del 2010. \n",
      "Sin embargo, como puede comprobarse en un rápido recorrido por las distintas redes sociales, los movimientos antivacunas siguen teniendo mucha fuerza. Pese a sustentarse en argumentos sin base científica que ponen en tela de juicio a un número preocupante de personas. Sobre todo, el argumentario de los antivacunas convence a la clase acomodada y educada del mundo occidental, que parece haber olvidado que gracias a las vacunas no morimos ahora de enfermedades como la difteria, la polio o el sarampión. \n",
      "Por ello, las directrices de la OMS son tajantes y se dirigen a intentar definitivamente aunar esfuerzos en contra de estos grupos organizados antivacunas. En un informe oficial, este organismo incluyó la insuficiente inmunización infantil entre las mayores amenazas para la salud y bienestar a nivel mundial. \n",
      "Asimismo, dentro de las convocatorias de proyectos científicos Horizonte 2020 que dedicó la Unión Europea (UE) específicamente al estudio de las enfermedades infecciosas y a la mejora de la Salud Pública, fue incluido un programa específico para proyectos (Call identifier SC1-BHC-33-2020), financiado con 9 millones de euros, para la promoción de propuestas que estudiaran cuáles eran los determinantes de la baja utilización de las vacunas dentro su territorio y desarrollaran nuevas estrategias de fomento de la vacunación y su nivel de cobertura. \n",
      "Y es que, según algunas estimaciones, el número de casos de enfermedades casi erradicadas como el sarampión ha aumentado un 30% y sigue siendo una de las primeras causas de ceguera a nivel mundial. La caída en las tasas mundiales de vacunación puede explicarse por razones muy diversas. Por ejemplo, en Ucrania, falleció un adolescente después de recibir una vacuna contra esta enfermedad. Aunque su muerte no tuvo nada que ver con la vacuna, disminuyó la confianza pública hasta el punto que el gobierno detuvo el programa de vacunación en 2008. La situación llegó al extremo de que los índices de vacunación contra el sarampión fueron de los más bajos en el mundo en 2016. \n",
      "Desgraciadamente, no hay un tratamiento específico para el sarampión, lo que hace que la vacunación sea la mejor forma de limitar la diseminación de esta enfermedad y evitar nuevos casos de ceguera.\n",
      "Por suerte en España, según un estudio de consulta telefónica promovido por la Fundación Española para la Ciencia y la Tecnología (FECYT) publicado esta semana pasada, un 60% de los españoles se muestran dispuestos a vacunarse sin reticencias frente al virus SARS-CoV-2, causante de la COVID-19. Tres veces más que en octubre del año pasado en plena segunda ola de contagios. \n",
      "Es más, el porcentaje sube a ocho de cada diez españoles que aseguran que se vacunarían si eso ayudase a proteger a sus mayores. De ahí la importancia de combatir los bulos difundidos por los movimientos antivacunas, que incluyen la existencia de sustancias muy peligrosas como aluminio y mercurio en los lotes fabricados de vacunas. \n",
      "Como apuntaban desde el Instituto de Salud Global de Barcelona en octubre de 2015, los padres tienen derecho a preguntar sobre los riesgos y beneficios de vacunar a sus hijos. Pero la comunidad científica tiene la obligación de informarles de forma clara y transparente. Y, claro está, como sociedad tenemos la responsabilidad de refutar todo tipo de fanatismo que se mantenga activamente negando la evidencia científica, por mucho ruido que hagan.\n",
      "Es evidente que, muy en el fondo de la cuestión, subyace el enfrentamiento entre la libertad individual y el compromiso colectivo. En este punto, conviene tener en mente el concepto de inmunidad colectiva, que se rige por el principio basado en el hecho irrefutable de que tasas altas de vacunación inducen una mayor protección de los individuos no vacunados. \n",
      "Es sabido que, cuando una enfermedad infecciosa invade un grupo sin vacunar, muchos de sus miembros se infectan porque carecen de la inmunidad contra la enfermedad. Ahora bien, si la vacunación es generalizada, esto limita la propagación de las enfermedades. Lo cual protege indirectamente a las personas no vacunadas porque es más difícil mantener la cadena de propagación de la infección. \n",
      "Para algunas enfermedades, la inmunidad colectiva puede empezar a inducirse con sólo un 40% de población vacunada. De ahí la importancia de que cada cual ejerza su deber o compromiso personal en pos de una mayor salud colectiva. Parece que este debate está llegando cada día más y con mayor interés hasta nuestros órganos de gobierno y responsables políticos. \n",
      "En este contexto, Italia prohibió a los menores de 6 años seguir acudiendo a los centros educativos del país sin estar vacunados, por lo que tan sólo en Bolonia unos 300 niños ya no pudieron acudir a la escuela infantil por no estar al día de sus vacunas. Y algo similar sucede en Alemania, donde quienes no brinden los registros de vacunación de sus hijos antes del 31 de julio de 2021 podrían enfrentarse a cuantiosas multas de hasta 2 500 € y dejar a sus hijos fuera del colegio.\n",
      "Parece indiscutible que no existen fundamentos científicos que pongan en duda la contribución de las vacunas para con el bienestar y la salud humana en un mundo plagado de constantes amenazas en forma de infecciones y ataques recurrentes de un sinfín de agentes oportunistas con el mismo afán de supervivencia que el nuestro (la “ley del más fuerte”). \n",
      "Antes de que se propaguen las prácticas administrativas que, en determinados países, fomentan el hábito de la vacunación, aquellos que no creen en ella tienen todo el derecho a no vacunarse. Pero es fundamental que sepan que su decisión pone en riesgo a terceros y puede hacer resurgir enfermedades hoy por hoy erradicadas gracias a la vacunación. \n",

      "As we get closer to an effective vaccine for COVID-19, we should expect to see a renewed push of disinformation and vocal resistance from the anti-vaccination movement. Over the past year, seemingly endless conspiracy theories and misinformation campaigns have gained traction online amidst rising COVID-19 infection rates worldwide. Looking at the history of these movements can help us understand why they can be so effective at capturing a popular following.\n",
      "As a historian of medicine, it’s become clear from researching the history of vaccines that those who promote anti-vaccination consistently use a standard set of strategies. Although it can be hard to see patterns of argument in the modern context, looking back at a historical instance of epidemic and misinformation provides a useful case study for revealing today’s recurring anti-vaccination strategies.\n",
      "One popular pamphlet published in 1885 during the smallpox epidemic in Montréal is a great example. Over a century later, we have the benefit of living in a world that has eradicated smallpox using a vaccine. Yet in the past, smallpox vaccination was hotly contested, despite the evidence in favour of its effectiveness.\n",
      "Published by a leading anti-vaccinationist, Dr. Alexander M. Ross, this pamphlet was widely circulated during the smallpox epidemic of 1885 in Montréal, as public health officials were seeking to increase vaccination coverage. \n",
      "Ross seized on the opportunity of increased health measures to gain authority, notoriety and personal fame. He painted himself the hero of his own story, the “only doctor; who had dared to doubt the fetish” of vaccination. Despite this, it was discovered that he had been recently vaccinated during the epidemic, a fact that was gleefully reported by the major newspapers at the time.\n",
      "His pamphlet serves as a prime illustration of the strategies used by anti-vaccinationists — both then and now. These arguments are not new and have changed little over time. Learning to recognize their repackaging in modern form can help with effectively combating their power.\n",
      "Ross and his anti-vaccination associates were quick to dismiss the threat of smallpox. Despite mortality rates between 30 and 40 per cent, and the extreme contagiousness of the disease, it was common for anti-vaccinationists to claim that smallpox was only a minor threat to a population. \n",
      "Ross decried the “senseless panic” caused by health officials and physicians over the epidemic, claiming that smallpox was not, in fact, epidemic, and that the city had “very few cases.” Official numbers for the epidemic would eventually rise to 9,600 reported cases with 3,234 deaths — nearly two per cent of Montréal’s population at the time. An additional 10,000 cases were recorded in the province of Québec, but historians believe the actual numbers were likely much higher. These numbers and the story of this epidemic have been narrated by historian Michael Bliss in his non-fiction account, Plague: A Story of Smallpox in Montreal. \n",
      "The minimization of threat is a common tactic in contemporary debates as well. Many who promote the anti-vaccination agenda claim vaccines to be more dangerous than the disease. \n",
      "Although modern arguments have focused on the false claim that vaccines cause autism, historic arguments were much more varied in their allegations of infections from the smallpox vaccine. The anti-vaccinationists of the past claimed that vaccination caused a full spectrum of diseases, from smallpox itself to syphilis, typhoid, tuberculosis, cholera and “blood-poisoning.” \n",
      "These claims were not always groundless, but their risks were consistently exaggerated. Cases had been known to occur of secondary disease transmission due to poor practice. Some physicians used arm-to-arm vaccination — meaning they would use the same instrument to vaccinate a whole line of people — or used vaccine prepared from a human source rather than a bovine source. The lack of sterile cleaning between operations or the use of vaccine prepared from an infected person could lead to rare cases of secondary disease transmissions. \n",
      "The discovery of such transmissions (years earlier) sparked some of the first regulations around vaccine preparation and administration, and generated a keen concern within the medical community about vaccine safety — a concern which has continued to be a mainstay of vaccine production to this day.\n",

      "Ross’s pamphlet was adamant about the role of both the press and the medical profession in stoking fears over infection as part of a “mad” campaign for gaining money. Much like today, epidemics created opportunities for both employment and research in the medical field. Yet this employment was painted as an unethical exploitation of the poor, worth “one million pounds sterling” to the profession, rather than an effort in combating the suffering and death of thousands.\n",
      "Additionally, public health measures were depicted as an assault on personal rights and an overreach of government power. “Talk no longer of Russian Tyranny,” Ross declared, for there was “none so formidable” as the city health officials. His arguments are still echoed over a century later in the current pandemic, as we see continued support behind the belief in a conspiracy to limit freedoms (among other, more extreme, conspiracy theories).\n",
      "Last but not least is an appeal to authorities that help legitimize the anti-vaccination argument. The modern anti-vaxxer movement has an abundance of these, led by Andrew Wakefield, the now discredited former physician who originally published the fraudulent study linking the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine to autism. \n",
      "But the anti-vaccination movement has had a long tradition of promoting the words of “experts” who support their narrative. In the 19th century, vaccination debates often brought in a similar small circle of medical men who spoke against vaccination, calling it a “filthy” and “evil” practice. Although their arguments were refuted by many in the medical community, they gained a lasting mantle of prestige amongst anti-vaccinationists as the authoritative voices that offered the “proof” that was needed.\n",
      "This is not an exhaustive list of anti-vaccination strategies — either historical or contemporary. There have always been individuals who capitalize on medical crises to push their own agenda, and in the modern age of digital media, strategies of misinformation have evolved and expanded. Much like Ross, the leaders of these movements gain social power by painting themselves as lone crusaders. \n",
      "As we get closer to a worldwide distribution of COVID-19 vaccine, we can expect to see more and more such crusaders publishing arguments against vaccination. Breaking down patterns of arguments seen repeatedly in the past can provide a useful lesson for combating them in the future.\n",

      "It is a coincidence that the news broke the day after Boris Johnson, the UK prime minister, provoked widespread outrage by proroguing parliament. But the increasing prevalence of measles must be understood in the broader context of rising populist sentiment and drawn-out political crises.\n",
      "Measles is a highly infectious and potentially deadly disease, but it can be prevented with a cheap and easily administered vaccine. If over 90-95% of a community is vaccinated, “herd immunity” is achieved and outbreaks are unlikely to occur. When the measles vaccine was introduced in 1963, the disease killed about 2.6m people a year. The number of measles cases has steadily declined since then, and it is estimated that the vaccine has saved over 21m lives since the turn of the century.\n",
      "Vaccines are widely agreed to be one of the great achievements of the scientific age. A survey of eminent historians by The Atlantic put vaccines as number eight in a list of the “greatest breakthroughs since the wheel”. And an article by the US librarian of Congress published in National Geographic placed vaccines fifth out of “ten inventions that changed the world”.\n",

      "But in the last few years, the remarkable progress made by vaccines has gone into reverse, particularly in the West. In Europe, there were about 5,000 cases of measles in 2016, 24,000 in 2017 and 84,000 in 2018. According to recent WHO data, there have already been 90,000 measles cases in the first six months of this year. And the US is experiencing its biggest measles outbreak for 27 years.\n",
      "Measles outbreaks are a consequence of falling vaccine coverage, which appears to result from increasingly widespread anxieties about vaccine safety. These fears go back at least to the 18th century when efforts to inoculate people against smallpox in Boston, US, were met with fierce resistance. Contemporary concerns about vaccine safety, however, are usually traced to debunked claims that there is a link between the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine and autism.\n",

      "This connection is rejected by mainstream scientists. Andrew Wakefield, the source of this conspiracy theory, was struck off by the UK’s General Medical Council for acting dishonestly and irresponsibly, and his published research was retracted by The Lancet. Earlier this year, a study of over 650,000 children in Denmark concluded that there was no evidence of a connection between MMR and autism – even among children who were seen to be of heightened risk, such as those with autistic siblings.\n",
      "Still, Wakefield’s ideas continue to have enormous influence. A survey of 2,600 parents published in January by the Royal Society for Public Health shows that 21% of parents in the UK think MMR causes unwanted side effects and almost 10% of parents chose not to give their child the MMR vaccine, mainly because of fears about side effects. \n",

Only 73% in Northern Europe (which includes the UK), 59% in Western Europe and 40% in Eastern Europe agreed with the statement that vaccines are safe. The figure was 72% for the US. The WHO listed vaccine hesitancy as a top ten global health threat for 2019 and one that “threatens to reverse progress made in tackling vaccine-preventable diseases”.\n",
      "The NHS points out “vaccination is safe and important” and the WHO states that “vaccines are safe”. This raises the question: why do so many people believe unproven theories over the informed advice of medical doctors and public health authorities?\n",

      "Interestingly, a study published last year revealed that the same Russian trolls and bots that interfered in the US presidential elections on behalf of Donald Trump spread disinformation about vaccines. This suggests that the Russian state is using the topic of vaccine safety to spread discord in the West.\n",
      "But growing vaccine hesitancy indicates a broader breakdown in trust in elites and experts that is behind Brexit and other political crises. In the run-up to the 2016 referendum, Michael Gove claimed that people have had enough of experts. He was referring to economists, but this sentiment has wider relevance in the so-called “post-truth” age, when appeals to emotion appear to be more effective at influencing opinion than facts and evidence.\n",
      "My own research shows that West European countries with the highest levels of electoral support for populist political parties, such as Greece, Italy and France, also have the highest percentage of people who do not believe that vaccines are important, safe or effective according to the Vaccine Confidence Project. In contrast, countries that have the lowest levels of populist votes, such as Portugal and Belgium, also have the lowest levels of vaccine hesitancy.\n",
      "The link between populism and vaccine hesitancy can be seen when we look at individual-level data. Survey results published in The Economist in 2014 showed that UKIP voters were almost five times more likely to believe that the MMR vaccine is unsafe. According to more recent data, which I helped The Guardian analyse, one-third of UKIP voters believed vaccines were unsafe compared with 10% of Labour voters and 11% of Conservative voters. We found similar patterns throughout Europe: supporters of right-wing populist parties were much more likely to question the safety of vaccines.\n",

In the Czech Republic, hundreds of thousands of people have taken to the streets this summer to protest against alleged economic fraud perpetrated by the billionaire prime minister Andrej Babiš. Greeks have suffered massively since 2008, with GDP still 20% lower than pre-crisis levels. Alexis Tsipras’ left-wing government was recently defeated by New Democracy, which has been described by some observers as a right-wing populist party.\n",
      "All this shows how political crises and measles go hand in hand. Just as Boris Johnson’s manoeuvring does not undo all the progress that has occurred in British politics since Charles I, the UK losing its measles-free status does not signify a return to the Dark Ages.

      "Pemberian imunisasi telah terbukti membuat masyarakat lebih sehat dan sejahtera karena vaksinasi mencegah terjadinya pengeluaran yang sia-sia akibat penyakit yang sebenarnya bisa dicegah. \n",
      "Riset Badan Kesehatan Dunia (WHO) yang mengestimasi dampak ekonomi dari vaksinasi periode 2001-2020 menyebutkan vaksinasi 10 jenis penyakit menular dapat mencegah 20 juta kematian di 73 negara, termasuk Indonesia. Vaksinasi, menurut riset tersebut, juga dapat menyelamatkan kerugian yang ditimbulkan sebesar US$350 miliar (hampir Rp5.000 triliun) untuk biaya perawatan kesehatan, sedangkan nilai ekonomi dan sosial yang lebih luas dari vaksinasi ini diperkirakan mencapai US$820 miliar (sekitar Rp11.700 triliun) di 73 negara tersebut.\n",
      "Tapi rupanya tingkat kepercayaan masyarakat Indonesia terhadap keampuhan vaksinasi perlu ditingkatkan. Akhir tahun lalu, Riset Kesehatan Dasar 2018 menunjukkan, alih-alih naik, cakupan imunisasi dasar lengkap (IDL) pada anak berusia 12-23 bulan hanya 57,9%. Ini turun dibanding lima tahun tahun lalu yang mencapai 59,2%. Lebih dari tiga juta anak usia tersebut tidak menerima vaksinasi lengkap. Sementara, untuk mencapai level imunitas yang optimal pada populasi semestinya cakupannya di atas 80 persen. \n",
      "Amat disayangkan bahwa data-data tentang manfaat vaksinasi seperti hasil riset WHO tersebut tidak bermakna apa-apa bagi sebagian orang tua akibat pengaruh berita palsu dan teori konspirasi tentang vaksinasi, yang marak tersebar melalui media sosial. Karena itu, kebijakan kesehatan dan komunikasi sains yang tepat sangat dibutuhkan untuk menyakinkan masyarakat ihwal manfaat imunisasi. \n",
      "Argumentasi yang sering kita dengar digunakan oleh orang dan kelompok anti-vaksin adalah hasil riset yang dilakukan (bekas) dokter Inggris Andrew Wakefield pada 1998. Riset tersebut diterbitkan di jurnal kedokteran prestisius The Lancet, tapi tak lama kemudian artikel tersebut dicabut oleh penerbit karena Wakefield terbukti terlibat pelanggaran etika penelitian yang serius berupa konflik kepentingan finansial dan pelanggaran ilmiah.\n",
      "Wakefield menjelaskan ada keterkaitan antara pemberian vaksin MMR (Mumps Measles rubella) dan risiko kejadian Pervasive Developmental Disorder (PDD) atau autisme. Penelitiannya mendorong khalayak untuk mengaitkan pemberian vaksin MMR dengan beberapa kriteria diagnostik autisme yang berupa aspek komunikasi, interaksi sosial, minat atau perhatian.\n",
      "Banyak penelitian setelahnya, termasuk studi terbaru yang terbit April 2019, dengan tegas membantah temuan palsu Wakefield dengan memberikan bukti yang solid bahwa vaksinasi MMR tidak meningkatkan risiko autisme, tidak memicu autisme, dan juga tidak ada kaitannya dengan Kejadian Ikutan Pasca Imunisasi (KIPI). \n",
      "Menariknya, meski sudah banyak studi serupa yang membantah temuan Wakefield dan dilakukan lebih cermat secara saintifik, kelompok anti-vaksin selalu mengutip studi, yang disebut oleh ahli kesehatan dari Universitas Charleston Amerika Dennis K Flaherty sebagai “hoaks kesehatan paling merusak selama 100 tahun terakhir” itu. Hoaks Wakefield ini amat berbahaya karena selalu dijadikan pembenaran kaum anti-vaksin untuk menolak vaksinasi dan mendorong terbentuknya mitos-mitos lainnya yang berhubungan dengan keamanan vaksinasi. \n",
      "Belakangan diketahui bahwa misinformasi dan disinformasi bukan satu-satunya faktor yang menjelaskan naiknya popularitas gerakan anti-vaksin, namun lebih dipengaruhi sentimen dan ideologi politik yang menyertainya. \n",
      "Laporan DailySocial tentang distribusi hoaks di media sosial pada 2018 menjelaskan bahwa informasi hoaks paling banyak ditemukan di Facebook (82,25 persen), WhatsApp (56,55%), dan Instagram (29,48%). \n",
      "Disinformasi tersebut amat beragam, mulai dari beberapa makanan penyebab kematian, penyebab kanker, vaksinasi dan imunisasi. Seiring meluasnya akses terhadap internet, penyebaran informasi palsu ini malah semakin sulit untuk dikendalikan. \n",
      "Perlawanan berbahaya terhadap kebenaran ilmiah terkait vaksin tak hanya di Indonesia. Di Amerika, politikus punya andil besar dalam maraknya disinformasi ini. Contohnya, bagaimana cara Presiden Amerika Serikat Donald Trump menanggapi kaitan antara vaksinasi dan kejadian autisme yang kemudian menjadi komoditas politik. Politikus Partai Republik yang terkenal konservatif itu mendukung dan membuat pembenaran atas penelitian Wakefield sehingga persoalan kredibilitas penelitian dan etik tidak menjadi hal yang patut diperhitungkan.\n",
      "Yang menyedihkan, masyarakat menganggap informasi palsu ini seolah-olah menggambarkan yang nyata terjadi. Informasi palsu mengenai vaksinasi ini semakin liar karena dibumbui berbagai teori konspirasi. \n",
      "Tokoh filantropis untuk gerakan pengendalian tembakau global dan politikus Partai Demokrat Amerika Michael R. Bloomberg dalam pidatonya di Rice University Mei tahun lalu, menyatakan para politikus populis terus menyangkal informasi faktual yang membuat publik merasa terancam. Bloomberg dengan tegas mengatakan “wabah ketidakjujuran” ini adalah satu-satunya komoditas yang terus dikapitalisasi oleh para politikus agar mendapatkan keuntungan elektoral. Namun kebenaran tetap kebenaran, sehingga kebohongan tak mungkin mampu terus-terusan menutupi yang sebenarnya terjadi.\n",
      "Karena itu, kehadiran bukti empirik dalam perumusan kebijakan kesehatan tak bisa ditawar-tawar. Saat ini pemerintah Indonesia belum mengembangkan strategi yang jelas untuk melawan miskonsepsi dan krisis kredibilitas pada figur ilmuwan dan penelitian ilmiah yang mendasari beragam kebijakan kesehatan. Padahal efeknya jelas dan langsung dirasakan, seperti menurunnya cakupan imunisasi.\n",
      "Para ilmuwan dan perumus kebijakan kesehatan harus memahami lanskap politik di era paska-kebenaran agar dapat melewati tantangan ini dengan baik. Komunitas akademik juga dituntut untuk mereformasi strategi mereka dalam melakukan komunikasi sains supaya menutup kesenjangan pemahaman antara ilmuwan dengan pengambil kebijakan dan masyarakat awam. \n",

      "We all know action on climate change is urgently needed. But that doesn’t mean a forest should be razed to build a wind farm. Nor should vast fields of a single crop be grown year after year – reducing the number of other species that can live there – even if the plant is used to produce renewable bio-fuel.\n",
      "Climate change and biodiversity loss are the two greatest challenges to humanity and our planet. But they’re often dealt with by separate laws and policies, which can lead to perverse, unwanted outcomes.\n",
      "Clearly, this siloed approach must change. This was recognised in a draft plan by the Convention on Biological Diversity, released overnight, which stated that biodiversity should not be harmed by efforts to tackle climate change.\n",
      "But how do we ensure solutions to one of these wicked problems does not worsen the other? Some 50 of the world’s leading researchers on biodiversity and climate have released a report which sought to answer this question. Below, I outline the conundrums we tackled and the solutions we came up with. \n",
      "Our report, released last month, represents the first ever collaboration between the world’s largest research and policy communities on biodiversity and climate – the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). \n",
      "IPBES is an independent intergovernmental body that synthesises evidence on the state of biodiversity, ecosystems and natures’ contributions to people. The IPCC is the United Nations body for assessing climate science. \n",
      "The word “biodiversity” refers to the variety of living things: all the animals, plants and tiny micro-organisms on Earth, including the genetic information they contain and the ecosystems they form.\n",
      "Biodiversity loss, then, is a reduction in the variety of species in an ecosystem, a geographic area or the planet as a whole. Biodiversity, including extinctions, is currently declining at rates unprecedented in human history.\n",
      "There’s a growing recognition that climate, biodiversity and human well-being are inextricably linked. \n",
      "To date, biodiversity loss has largely been caused by human actions which harm land, rivers and oceans. However, research suggests worsening climate change will be the main cause of global biodiversity loss this century.\n",
      "For example, climate change is causing marine heatwaves which threaten the existence of the Great Barrier Reef. Climate change also makes bushfires more intense and frequent, pushing species closer to extinction. \n",
      "Biodiversity loss can also make climate change worse. For example, forests store large amounts of carbon, and their destruction is a key source of greenhouse gas emissions. \n",

      "Bioenergy crops such as corn, canola and soybeans can be processed and used as a fuel for heat or energy. This can provide an alternative energy source to fossil fuels. And forest plantations storing carbon dioxide can be an effective way to reduce atmospheric carbon levels. \n",
      "But these climate solutions can be bad for nature. Crop or forest monocultures greatly diminish the diversity of other plant and animal species the land can support. Such practices can also degrade ecosystems and damage native species. \n",
      "Similarly, renewable energy technologies can harm biodiversity. For example, large-scale solar plants across vast areas of land can destroy animal habitat and disrupt wildlife movement.  \n",
      "Crucially, climate and biodiversity interventions can also be harmful to human well-being. Many communities in developing countries rely directly on nature for their everyday needs. Efforts to protect biodiversity by locking up natural areas in forest reserves can deprive local people of their lands and erode their food security.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Our report sets out key steps to protecting the climate, biodiversity and human well-being in unison. I outline these below.\n",
      "Protect and restore carbon-rich ecosystems\n",
      "This is the number one priority for joint action on climate and biodiversity. It is critical, however, that such processes involve – and consider the needs of – local communities. They must also take future climate conditions into account.\n",
      "Slash carbon emissions\n",
      "By storing carbon in forests, wetlands and other ecosystems, nature can do a lot to tackle climate change. But it can’t do everything. Ambitious reductions in greenhouse gas emissions are needed across multiple sectors of the global economy. Without this, it will be virtually impossible to restore and protect natural ecosystems.\n",
      "Increase sustainable agricultural and forestry practices\n",
      "Food systems contribute up to one-third of total human-caused greenhouse gas emissions. The agricultural sector must urgently reduce waste. And if humans, particularly those in rich countries, eat less meat this will also help address emissions and biodiversity loss. In the forestry sector, careful species selection and management can mitigate climate while being good for biodiversity.\n",
      "Eliminate harmful subsidies\n",
      "Government subsidies for activities that harm the environment, such as burning fossil fuels, should be removed.\n",
      "The above measures will not be easily achieved. And they are each contingent on revolutionary economic and societal shifts.\n",
      "Unsustainable consumption and production are key causes of climate change and biodiversity loss. Our report calls for a shift in individual and societal values away from materialism. We must also challenge the dominant worldview which equates continuous economic growth with human well-being.\n",
      "Justice and equity must be at the centre of our new ways of being. Indigenous and local communities should lead the stewardship of forest, lands and seas. And system-wide change should not disproportionately impact the already disadvantaged.\n",
      "And all this will require coordinated action at local, national and global scales. This must integrate multiple knowledge systems and worldviews.\n",
      "A bright future for people and nature is possible. But achieving win-wins across climate, biodiversity and society requires urgent, transformative and just action which addresses not only the symptoms, but the causes of our greatest problems.\n",

      "It’s a grim and all too common sight for rangers at some of Africa’s nature reserves: the bullet-riddled carcass of an elephant, its tusks removed by poachers. African elephant populations have fallen by about 30% since 2006. Poaching has driven the decline.\n",
      "Some reserves, like Garamba in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Selous in Tanzania, have lost hundreds of elephants to poachers over the last decade. But others, like Etosha National Park in Namibia, have been targeted far less. What might explain this difference?\n",
      "That’s what we set out to explore in our new paper. We investigated why poaching rates vary so widely across Africa and what this might reveal about what drives, motivates and facilitates poaching. To do this, we used a statistical model to relate poaching levels from 64 African sites to various socio-economic factors. These included a country’s quality of governance and the level of human development in the area surrounding a park.\n",
      "Our findings suggest that poaching rates are lower where there is strong national governance and where local levels of human development – especially wealth and health – are relatively high. Strong site-level law enforcement and reduced global ivory prices also keep poaching levels down.\n",
      "Understanding these dynamics is crucial. The illegal wildlife trade is one of the highest value illicit trade sectors globally, worth several billion dollars each year. It poses a major threat to biodiversity and ecosystems, which are the bedrock of human well-being. And elephants are more than just a culturally significant icon. They are “ecosystem engineers” that can boost forest carbon stocks and diversify habitats through their feeding. Their presence in national parks and reserves also has economic benefits, bringing in valuable tourism revenues.\n",
      "The deaths of both poachers and rangers in the continent’s violent biodiversity “war” also underscores our findings: when elephants lose, we all lose.\n",
      "We developed a statistical model using 19 years of data on 10,286 poached elephants at 64 sites in 30 African countries. These data were collected, mostly by wildlife rangers, as part of the global programme for Monitoring the Illegal Killing of Elephants (MIKE), administered by the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). \n",
      "We then linked the poaching data to key socio-economic data related to areas around the parks, individual countries and global markets.\n",
      "Poaching of high-value species like elephants and rhinos is driven primarily by sophisticated criminal syndicates. So we used criminology theory and evidence from the scientific literature to generate hypotheses about factors that might drive, facilitate or motivate the decisions of these syndicates and the local hunters they recruited. We then identified datasets representing these factors, such as the Uppsala Armed Conflict Dataset and the Global Data Lab’s Subnational Human Development index.\n",

      "Our tailored statistical model allows us to test for the effect of one hypothesised driver of poaching while accounting for the others. It also means we can look at local, national, regional and global factors together.\n",
      "Parks with higher levels of human development (based on health and wealth metrics from household surveys) and stronger law enforcement suffered less poaching. Poaching was also lower in countries where there was strong national governance quality. We measured this using the World Bank’s governance indicators. \n",
      "Socio-economic and political drivers were far more common than ecological ones. A park’s accessibility and size, the density of its vegetation and its elephant population did not affect its poaching levels. \n",
      "The strong associations we found between poaching and factors like corruption and human development do not necessarily imply that these factors directly cause poaching. Correlation does not imply causation. Deeper research at particular sites will reveal what underlying processes are at play, and offer a better understanding of cause and effect. \n",
      "But we do have some suggestions about what might lie behind the associations we found. These are rooted in previous studies.\n",
      "Why, for instance, would higher levels of local human well-being in an area be associated with lower poaching?\n",
      "One explanation could be that, in areas of economic deprivation and in the absence of alternatives, local residents might participate in poaching to meet their basic needs or earn extra income.\n",
      "Another interpretation might be that criminal ivory syndicates seeking to recruit local hunters target areas of lower human well-being because they can operate more effectively there.\n",
      "A number of biodiversity conservation actors, like government wildlife departments or environmental NGOs, have already recognised the value in focusing on improving human well-being around parks and reserves. A stellar example is Namibia’s conservancy model. It achieves effective conservation through local communities governing and benefiting from wildlife. \n",
      "Our study highlights that site-based conservation action alone cannot control illegal killing. A lot of what drives and facilitates elephant poaching is beyond conservationists’ remit or control.\n",
      "Conservationists can’t be expected to solve local human development issues or hold governments accountable on their own. Wider societal action to address poverty is required. This could include empowering women, increasing access to basic education, and promoting resilience to climate change. Such action is valuable in its own right, but will likely deliver benefits for elephants too.  \n",
      "Finally, the positive relationship that we found between poaching and ivory prices suggests that tackling demand for illegal wildlife in end-markets is a key part of the puzzle.\n",
      "We suggest that tackling elephant poaching, and indeed the broader illegal wildlife trade, requires dealing with the wider systemic challenges of human development, corruption and consumer demand. It is not enough to just focus on actions traditionally defined as “wildlife conservation”.\n",

      "Across the African continent the populations of both species of African elephants – forest and savanna – have been declining due to habitat loss, poaching and human-wildlife conflict. \n",
      "Forest elephants are listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as “Critically Endangered” – a category for species that have declined over 80% within three generations. And it has listed savanna elephants as “Endangered” – indicating a decline of over 50% within three generations.\n",
      "But there remains some areas where there is both high quality habitat and stable elephant populations. These include Gabon, the northern Republic of Congo, northern Botswana, northern Tanzania and northern Kenya. \n",
      "Gabon holds roughly half of all forest elephants, which occur across almost the entire country’s area (about 250,000km2). It is the principal stronghold of a species that once numbered in the millions.\n",

      "\n",
      "Securing this stronghold is vitally important to the species’ future. Given the slow rate of forest elephant reproduction recruitment species recovery in more depleted areas will be slow.\n",
      "To ensure good decision-making for wildlife conservation, it’s important to know how many elephants there are. Researchers, practitioners and policy-makers all need data they can trust when designing new protected areas, managing existing ones, and creating national and international conservation laws and strategies.\n",
      "We set out to answer the question: How many forest elephants are in Gabon right now? \n",
      "Elephant surveys within Gabon since 2004 have covered just under a quarter of the nation’s elephant habitat, but over the last decade (since 2011) only 14% of the habitat has been surveyed. \n",
      "Thanks to a collaborative approach between the Wildlife Conservation Society, the Gabonese National Parks Agency and Vulcan Inc (a philanthropic foundation), we were able to plan and implement our nationwide, systematic population survey of forest elephants in Gabon using DNA from fresh elephant dung. \n",
      "This was the first national DNA-based assessment of any free-ranging large mammal in Africa.\n",
      "Our first aim was to collect as many dung samples as possible. We then assigned each dungpile to an individual elephant using DNA analysis. \n",
      "Our survey covered 18 plots, each at about 2,000km2 in size, which were spaced across the entire country. We looked for fresh elephant dung within each of sites, walking for about three weeks per site – a total of almost 8,300 km, a distance which is the equivalent of Canada to Gabon! \n",
      "We collected samples from just over 4,000 fresh dungpiles, which after DNA analysis, were found to have been deposited by almost 1,760 individuals (of which almost 70% were from females). \n",
      "Our results estimated that there are 95,110 forest elephants in Gabon. Our population estimation method depends on a proportion of individual elephants being “captured” more than once, a method formally known as spatially explicit capture-recapture. We also estimated that they lived at an average population density of 0.38 per km2, or roughly one elephant per square mile.\n",
      "Elephant densities were highest in relatively flat areas with a high proportion of reasonably intact lowland tropical forests. They were not found in high densities near the national border. \n",
      "Interestingly, human presence and activity did not appear to be strong predictors of elephant density. By contrast, elsewhere in Central Africa elephants avoid roads, villages, and populated areas. This is probably because Gabon has lower levels of elephant poaching than other countries. Gabon also has one of the lowest human population densities in Africa and over 90% of the population live in towns and cities. In the very lightly populated rural regions, there may be roughly one elephant for every twenty inhabitants. \n",
      "As key species in their ecosystem, forest elephants provide unique ecological services related to seed dispersal, trampling and nutrient cycling. This is why they are called “ecosystem engineers” and “mega-gardeners”. \n",
      "More recent work has shown the link between elephants and carbon sequestration. This is because tree species whose seeds are dispersed by elephants tend to be much larger, with higher wood density and higher carbon content than tree species dispersed by other methods, such as by monkeys or the wind.\n",
      "Unfortunately, despite their importance, there have been increasing reports of human-elephant conflict (crop-raiding) in some areas. This has become a highly charged political issue, as farmers blame their crop damage on elephant protection,  which undermines conservation efforts. \n",
      "Since 2012 there have been studies in Gabon along the coast, a national review, and more recent reports and investigations into appropriate methods for elephant conservation. \n",
      "Having acknowledged the updated forest elephant estimates provided in our study, the Gabonese government initiated a series of national meetings in December 2021. The aim was to outline a national strategy plan that addresses the concerns of the local communities affected by elephants.\n",
      "This is a welcome step forward. Our study provides a useful baseline with which to regularly monitor Gabon’s ambitious environmental and development policy goals.\n",

      "Humans have been over-exploiting African elephants for centuries. More than 2,000 years ago, the Roman Empire’s demand for ivory led to the extinction of genetically distinct elephant populations in northern Africa. But in recent times, population increases among southern African elephants and declines across the rest of the continent have made it hard to clearly assess how threatened the species is overall. \n",
      "I serve on a team of scientists that recently reviewed African elephants’ status for the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). We compiled data from over 400 sites across Africa, spanning 50 years of conservation efforts – and our results were grim. \n",
      "The number of African savanna elephants – the largest subspecies of elephants – has declined by 60% since 1990. And forest elephants, which the IUCN is treating as a separate species for the first time, have declined in number by over 86%. Based on our assessment, the IUCN has changed its listing from “vulnerable” for all African elephants to “endangered” for savanna elephants and “critically endangered” for forest elephants.\n",
      "By separating savanna and forest elephants into independent assessments, our report reveals the critical state of the more elusive forest elephants, which was obscured in previous reviews that lumped all of Africa’s elephants together. Scientific evidence for separating the species has been building over the past two decades, and many taxonomists felt this recognition was long overdue.  \n",
      "Increased research on forest elephants highlights the dramatic declines these secretive giants are undergoing. Studies also show that they are among the slowest-reproducing mammals on the planet. This means that even if they receive adequate protection, their recovery will take decades. \n",
      "Scientists believe that elephant populations across Africa actually increased during the early 20th century, when nations were entrenched in global wars and consumption of ivory and other luxury items declined. After World War II, however, conspicuous consumption surged. Over-hunting for ivory drove severe declines in the number of elephants in the 1970s and 1980s. \n",
      "Thanks to interconnected global trade networks, along with porous and unregulated borders in many parts of Africa, rising ivory demand in one part of the world quickly translates into higher black market ivory prices in Africa. And these higher prices lead to poaching.\n",
      "Removing elephants from an area can pave the way for converting forests and grasslands to agriculture. This cycle has led to the depletion of much of African elephants’ historic range.  \n",
      "Habitat loss also brings elephants and humans closer together, leading to more human-elephant conflict. Such clashes lead to the direct loss of elephants. They also are a burden for local communities that can erode their interest in and support for conservation. \n",
      "While the scale of decline in Africa’s elephant populations is overwhelming, there are many examples of successful conservation efforts across the continent. The KAZA (Kavango-Zambezi) Transfrontier Conservation effort, anchored by Botswana, holds the largest contiguous elephant population on the continent, and that population has experienced strong growth over the past 50 years. This success reflects government collaboration across borders and work with local communities. \n",
      "Joint international efforts to reduce the illegal ivory trade are raising awareness of the problems with ivory consumption. China banned domestic ivory trade in 2017, and concurrently ivory poaching across many elephant populations in Africa declined – including in the largest populations in Tanzania and Kenya, which were under severe pressure less than 10 years ago. The core population of forest elephants in Gabon, which declined by 80% between 2004 and 2014, has stabilized with increased government investment and reduced poaching pressure. \n",
      "Innovative work with communities in countries such as Namibia and Kenya to enhance people’s livelihoods by developing wildlife-supported economies has led to the protection of enormous tracts of lands as conservation areas. And researchers and conservationists are working to find solutions to conflicts between human activities and elephant needs that can be applied across Africa. \n",
      "By highlighting the precarious state of Africa’s two elephant species, my colleagues and I hope that this Red List Assessment can help motivate African countries with elephant populations and the international community to invest in measures that support elephant conservation. \n",
      "Elephants provide much more than just aesthetic benefits. Recent studies show forest elephants also play an important role in fighting climate change by enhancing carbon storage in central African forests, among the most important carbon reserves on the planet. The elephants disperse seeds and thin out young trees as they forage, which makes room for larger trees to thrive. \n",
      "Elephants also are a linchpin of the wildlife-based economy across Africa. And elephants, in compliment with fire, are considered to be ecosystem engineers that structure the balance between trees and grass on Africa’s savannas. Along with many other conservation experts, I see reversing their decline as a global imperative that requires concerted global support.\n",

      "L’extinction des éléphants de forêt d'Afrique pourrait aggraver le phénomène du réchauffement climatique. C’est ce qu’on peut apprendre d’une nouvelle étude publiée dans la revue Nature Geoscience qui relie l’alimentation des éléphants à une augmentation de la capacité des forêts à stocker le carbone.\n",
      "La mauvaise nouvelle, c’est que l'éléphant de forêt d'Afrique - plus petit et vulnérable que son cousin mieux connu, l’éléphant de brousse - est en voie d’extinction rapide. Si nous continuons à permettre son extermination, nous empirerons également le climat. La bonne nouvelle, c’est qui si nous le protégeons, nous combattrons également le changement climatique.\n",
      "Ces pachydermes sont des animaux fascinants, et cela fait plus de 15 ans que je les observe. Ils sont intelligents, sensibles, et profondément sociables. Mais ce qu’il y a de plus remarquable chez eux, c’est assurément leur taille. C’est pour se protéger des prédateurs tels que lions et tigres qu’ils ont fait le pari d’évoluer jusqu’à atteindre cette taille dissuasive, même si elle reste plus petite que celle des éléphants de brousse.\n",
      "En contrepartie, ils sont devenus esclaves de leur appétit. Les éléphants ont besoin d’une quantité massive de nourriture au quotidien, aux alentours de 5 10 pour cent de leur masse corporelle. Une femelle typique pesant trois tonnes peut manger 200 kg de matière végétale en une seule journée. Et pour une famille, le total peut dépasser une tonne par jour.\n",
      "Ce n’est guère facile de trouver autant de nourriture, surtout dans la forêt tropicale humide, car les plantes qu’on y trouve contiennent de fortes teneurs en toxines afin d’éviter d’être mangées. Les éléphants passent leur vie à manger et à chercher à manger. Ce sont de véritables « estomacs sur pattes ». Les éléphants de forêt d'Afrique apprécient tout particulièrement les arbustes, les jeunes arbres, et les plantes qui poussent dans les nouvelles clairières en forêt. Ces nouvelles pousses croissent rapidement à la suite d’une perturbation et produisent moins de défenses chimiques. La densité de leur bois est également plus faible que celle des espèces d’arbres qui poussent plus lentement.\n",
      "La façon dont les éléphants se nourrissent est tout aussi remarquable. Ils brisent d’abord les tiges et les branches, arrachent les lianes, déterrent entièrement les plantes, séparent les feuilles de leurs brindilles, etc. On remarque facilement leur passage car ils laissent un gros fouillis derrière eux.\n",
      "Le nouvel élément clé de l’étude présentée par l’écologiste Fabio Berzaghi et ses collègues est l’inclusion de l’effet des perturbations causées par les habitudes alimentaires des éléphants dans un modèle informatique qui simule des processus démographiques dans l’écosystème des forêts. C’est une première. Les chercheurs ont découvert que les « perturbations des éléphants » - c’est à dire le fouillis qu’ils laissent derrière eux - a pour effet de laisser derrière eux moins d’arbres, mais de plus grande taille. \n",
      "Les éléphants choisissent les arbres de densité faible, et de ce fait favorisent la dominance d’arbres matures, ce qui à terme résulte en une augmentation de la biomasse. Berzaghi et ses collègues ont réussi à valider les prévisions de leur modèle grâce aux données récoltées sur des parcelles forestières situées dans le bassin du Congo.\n",
      "En évitant les arbres les plus grands et denses, les éléphants permettent à la forêt de capturer plus de carbone. Ces résultats sont lourds de conséquences, tant pour la préservation des éléphants que pour les politiques à adopter en matière de carbone. Les auteurs estiment que la disparition de ces pachydermes entraînerait une perte de l’ordre de 7 pour cent des stocks de carbone dans les forêts de l’Afrique centrale, soit un coût estimé de l’ordre de 43 milliards de dollars US en mesures de remédiation (sur la base d’un prix conservateur pour le carbone). \n",
      "Bref, les éléphants de forêt sont nos amis dans la lutte contre le réchauffement climatique, et leur existence nous épargne des dizaines de milliards en remédiation.\n",
      "La situation des éléphants de forêt d'Afrique est particulièrement critique. Alors qu’on en dénombrait des millions, leur nombre se situe désormais à moins de 10 pour cent de leur potentiel. Durant la décennie 2002 à 2011, près de 62 pour cent des élépahnts auraient été abattus. Ceci serait principalement le résultat du braconnage afin de satisfaire à la demande asiatique pour l’ivoire, ainsi qu’à l’empiétement des humains sur leur habitat. Quelle tristesse que ce massacre qui est aussi un désastre écologique…\n",
      "La communauté scientifique reconnaît dans son ensemble que les éléphants de brousse (Loxodonta africana) et de forêt (L. cyclotis) sont des des espèces distinctes. Cependant, en raison de défis d’ordre pratique (comme par exemple une grande population hybridée), l’Union internationale pour la conservation de la nature (UICN), qui suit les espèces menacées, les a groupés. Le problème, c’est que la grande population d’éléphants de brousse dissimule la diminution draconienne du nombre de leurs cousins de la forêt.\n",
      "Berzaghi et ses collègues soulignent l’importance de reconnaître les éléphants de forêt en tant qu’espèce distincte. Cela leur donnerait une place séparée sur la liste rouge de l’UICN. Ils seraient probablement classifiés « espèce menacée » - ce qui déclencherait des interventions et une importante réglementation.\n",
      "Berzaghi et ses collègues nous ont montré que les éléphants de forêts sont au service de l’écosystème en contribuant à la stabilité du climat dont nous bénéficions tous, y compris vous et moi qui ne mettrons jamais les pieds en Afrique centrale. Si nous sommes bénéficiaires du travail de conservation des éléphants, nous devrions également être responsables de ce travail. Les sociétés les plus affluentes doivent assumer une plus grand part de responsabilité afin de protéger les éléphants et autres espèces de la biodiversité tropicale dont nous sommes les légataires.\n",
      "Nous avons beaucoup appris durant cette dernière décennie sur l’importance des éléphants et autres gros animaux dans le fonctionnement des écosystèmes. Il est temps d’utiliser ces connaissances. Berzaghi et son équipe ont fait la preuve de la corrélation entre une seule espèce et son impact climatique à l’échelle mondiale. \n",

If we allow their ongoing extermination to continue, we will be also worsening climate change.

      "In exchange, they became slaves to their appetite. Elephants need huge amounts of food everyday, something like 5-10% of their body mass. A typical three-tonne female could eat 200 kg of plant material in one day. Her family may need to consume more than a tonne of food per day. \n",
      "It is not easy to find so much food, especially in tropical rain forests, where plants have high concentrations of chemical defences (toxins) to avoid being eaten. Elephants spend most of their life eating and looking for food. We can think of them as “eating machines”. African forest elephants are particularly fond of saplings, young trees, and the plants that first grow into newly opened gaps in the forest. These “early succession” plants are specialised in growing fast following a disturbance and they invest less in chemical defences. Early succession trees also have lower wood density than slow-growing late-succession tree species.\n",
      "Elephant eating manners are also remarkable. They feed by breaking stems and branches, pulling down lianas, uprooting whole plants, stripping leaves off twigs, and so on. It is easy to notice their presence because of the mess they leave behind. \n",
      "The key novelty of the new study, by the ecologist Fabio Berzaghi and colleagues, is they include, for the first time, the effect of elephant feeding disturbances in a computer model that simulates  demographic processes in forest ecosystems. They found that “elephant disturbance” – all that messy eating – results in forests having fewer, larger trees. Elephants filter out small early-succession (i.e. low wood density) trees, promoting the dominance of late-succession (high wood density) trees, which ultimately leads to long-term increases in the total biomass. Berzaghi and colleagues were able to validate their model predictions with data from real forest plots in the Congo Basin.\n",
      "By promoting these larger, woodier trees, elephant feeding disturbances therefore mean the forest stores more carbon. These results have important and far reaching implications for elephant conservation and carbon policy. The authors estimate that the disappearance of African forest elephants would result in a loss of as much as 7% of the carbon stocks in Central African forests, which they valued at around US$43 billion, based on a conservative carbon stock price. In short, forest elephants are our allies in the fight against climate change and their existence saves us tens of billions of dollars in climate responses.\n",
      "The situation of African forest elephants is particularly dramatic. Once numbered in the millions, their population is now less than 10% of its potential size and, in the decade from 2002 to 2011, as many as 62% of forest elephants might have been killed. This decline is mostly due to poaching to feed Asian demand for ivory as well as increasing human encroaching of their habitats. What a sad reason for a massacre and an ecological disaster. \n",
      "Scientists largely recognise African bush (Loxodonta africana) and forest (L. cyclotis) elephants as different species. However because of practical challenges (such as dealing with abundant hybrid populations), the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), which officially tracks endangered species, has kept the two together. The problem is that the more populous bush elephants have masked a drastic reduction in their forest cousins. \n",
      "Berzaghi and colleagues emphasise the need for forest elephants to be finally acknowledged as their own species. This would give them a separate IUCN Red List status – probably marked as “endangered” – and trigger important policies and actions.\n",
      "Berzaghi and colleagues show that forest elephants produce ecosystem services in the form of climate stability from which we all benefit, including people like you and me who might never visit the forests of Central Africa. If we are all beneficiaries of elephant conservation, we should be also responsible for it. It is very important that more affluent societies assume a bigger share of the responsibility to conserve the elephants and other tropical biodiversity from which we benefit.\n",
      "In the past decade we have learned a lot about how important elephants and other large animals are for functioning ecosystems. It is time to apply this knowledge. Berzaghi and colleagues produced evidence linking the behaviour of a single species – feeding disturbances by African forest elephants – to global-scale climatic impacts. As mentioned earlier, the bad news is that we humans are killing elephants and ruining our planet. The good news is that we could synergise efforts and fight climate change by effectively protecting and restoring forest elephant populations and their habitats. The choice seems obvious to me.\n",

      "A new study from the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center has found that broccoli, Brussels sprouts, kale, cauliflower, cabbage and collard greens contain a substance that could inactivate a vital gene that plays a role in cancers. Their study titled, “Reactivation of PTEN tumor suppressor for cancer treatment through inhibition of a MYC-WWP1 inhibitory pathway,” was published in the latest issue of the journal Science.\n",
      "The authors led by Pier Paolo Pandolfi, Director of the Cancer Center and Cancer Research Institute at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, write that there have been numerous studies that show the cancer-protective effects of broccoli and other members of the family including cruciferous vegetables. They contain a substance that targets a gene called the WWP1 and thus in lab animals they were shown to suppress tumour growth. Pandolfi in a statement said, “We found a new important player that drives a pathway critical to the development of cancer, an enzyme that can be inhibited with a natural compound found in broccoli and other cruciferous vegetables. This pathway emerges not only as a regulator for tumor growth control, but also as an Achilles' heel we can target with therapeutic options.”\n",
      "Potent tumor suppressive gene, PTEN, the team explains is a common tumour suppressor gene that commonly undergoes mutations and is deleted or down regulated or silenced. This means that this gene is unable to stop the onset and progression of the cancers. Persons who inherit a mutated version of this gene have a greater risk of getting cancers as well as developmental defects. Each individual carries two copies of the gene – each from either parent. If they carry one defective suppressor gene the activity of PTEN might be reduced. Researchers speculated that if they could increase the activity of the existing PTEN, they could suppress the tumours or cancers. Aiming at finding molecules that could regulate and increase PTEN activity the team set on carrying series of experiments on cancer susceptible lab mice and on human cells in the lab.\n",
      "The researchers found a gene called the WWP1 that plays a role in development and growth of cancers. This gene produces an enzyme which was found to stop the protective or tumour suppressive actions of PTEN. The team then noted that indole-3-carbinol (I3C) – a component of broccoli could inhibit the effects of WWP1 and thus protect the PTEN activities that suppress the tumour. Pandolfi and colleagues then administered I3C to lab animals that were susceptible to cancer and noted that this allowed PTEN to protect the animals from cancer.\n",
      "Yu-Ru Lee, PhD, researcher at the Pandolfi lab, who is the first author of the study said that the amount of the molecule needed to provide anticancer benefits would be around 6 pounds of raw Brussels sprouts a day to achieve same levels of the molecule’s dose as in the lab mice. However the authors of the study assure that this knowledge or the key to potentiating PTEN is the big news from this study. They hope that research in this area would soon unlock medicines that target PTEN and potentiate its action as a protector against cancer.\n",
      "Pandolfi hoped for further research success and said, “Either genetic or pharmacological inactivation of WWP1 with either CRISPR technology or I3C could restore PTEN function and further unleash its tumor suppressive activity. These findings pave the way toward a long-sought tumor suppressor reactivation approach to cancer treatment.”\n",
      "Authors of the study wrote in conclusion, “These findings pave the way toward a long-sought tumor suppressor “reactivation” approach to cancer treatment... PTEN impairment is widely pervasive in various human cancers, targeting this pathway toward PTEN reactivation may represent an “Achilles heel” of broad application”\n",
      "The study received support from the National Institutes of Health.\n",
      "Recently researchers from the Czech Republic recently looked at beneficial effects of the ingredients of broccoli. Their study, “Isothiocyanate from Broccoli, Sulforaphane, and Its Properties,” was published in February 2019 in the Journal of Medicinal Food.\n",
      "The authors of the study write about the molecule “sulforaphane” which is an isothiocyanate that is stored in the form of glucoraphanin within cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli, broccoli sprouts, cauliflower, cabbage and kale. They explain that the glucoraphanin in the plants in converted to sulforaphane using an enzyme called myrosinase.\n",
      "They reviewed the studies that explored the anti-cancer and cancer protective properties of sulforaphane. They also speculate the sulforaphane can help in other diseases such as osteoporosis, heart and circulatory disease and autism as well.\n",
      "In other related research a team led by Nadia Castro from the Tumor Growth Factor Section, Mouse Cancer Genetics Program, NCI, Frederick, Maryland and colleagues in March this year published the results of their work titled, “Sulforaphane Suppresses the Growth of Triple-negative Breast Cancer Stem-like Cells In vitroand In vivo” in the journal Cancer Prevention Research (Philadelphia Pa.). \n",
      "They found that sulphorane found is broccoli could benefit women with a specific type of breast cancer called “Triple Negative Breast cancer” or TNBC. They studied the effects of this molecule of cancer-stem like cells or CSC that were isolated from patients and used in labs. They initiated the cancer in lab mice that were given daily injections of 50 mg sulforaphane/kg for 5 and 3 weeks, respectively. They noted that the TNBC cells having self renewal properties were inhibited by the sulforaphane. The authors found that this molecule targeted “Cripto-mediated oncogenic signaling pathway” in order to achieve this tumour inhibition.\n",
      "Results revealed that suoforaphane was capable of inhibiting proliferation of cells and also stopped the CSC cells from growing. The authors concluded from the study that, “findings indicate that sulforaphane (50 mg/kg) suppresses mammary tumor development in a TNBC animal model, possibly by targeting a CSC population... collective results in this study suggest that the use of sulforaphane for chemoprevention of TNBC is plausible and warrants further clinical evaluation.”\n",

      "A new study from Brown University shows that the dietary intake of vitamin A from plant sources is associated with a lower risk of a common type of skin cancer called squamous cell carcinoma. This is the second most common carcinoma of the skin in fair-skinned people.\n",
      "The role of vitamin A in helping skin cells to grow and mature is well known, but its usefulness in lowering skin cancer risk has been a matter of controversy. The use of sunblock, and avoiding exposure to strong sunlight, have been recommended to lower skin cancer incidence. The current study suggests that eating fruits and vegetables rich in vitamin A can be another good way to lower this risk.\n",
      "The study was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association Dermatology on July 31, 2019.\n",
      "The current research evaluated dietary vitamin A intakes and skin cancer detection rates in two large observational studies conducted over several years. These are the Nurses’ Health Study from 1984 to 2012, which looked at over 75,000 American women, and the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study from 1986 to 2012, including over 48,000 American males. The data gathered from these subjects included their dietary intake, history of skin cancer, hair color, severe sunburn incidents, and family history of skin cancer, all of which contribute to the risk for skin cancer.\n",
      "In total, about 123,000 subjects were found to be negative for a history of skin cancer and had submitted multiple forms on their dietary intakes. All of them were white, which put them at a higher risk of skin cancer. Among these, there were almost 4,000 cases of squamous cell carcinoma over the study up period.\n",
      "The researchers were looking for evidence of association between skin cancer and vitamin A intake. They classified the subjects into five categories based on average vitamin A intake levels. The conclusion they drew was that those who had the highest intake had a 17% lower risk of squamous cell carcinoma compared to those with the lowest intake. This could be compared to eating two large carrots or one medium baked sweet potato daily, vs a third of a cup of fried sweet potato wedges or one small carrot. However, the startling fact is that even this lowest category is above the US RDA (Recommended Dietary Allowance), which may mean that these recommendations need to be updated.\n",
      "Another finding was that most of the ingested vitamin A came from fruits and vegetables rather than from supplements or from animal-based products. Plants rich in vitamin A, besides carrots and sweet potatoes, include leafy green vegetables like lettuce, as well as fruits like apricots or cantaloupes. Compounds like vitamin A, such as lycopene, were found in tomatoes and watermelon, and are also found to reduce the skin cancer risk. Animal foods containing abundant vitamin A include milk, liver and oily fish.\n",
      "Researcher Eunyoung Cho says, “Our study provides another reason to eat lots of fruits and vegetables as part of a healthy diet.”\n",
      "Vitamin A is a fat-soluble vitamin which is converted into various retinoids, which are bioactive compounds required for proper maturation and differentiation of epithelial cells. Synthetic forms of these compounds are employed to prevent skin cancer in high-risk populations but have significant potential for harm. Hence the current study’s focus on natural sources of vitamin A for the chemoprevention of skin cancer is justified.\n",
      "The analysis compensated for the presence of the other high-risk factors mentioned earlier. However, because these studies did not ask about measures to avoid the strong mid-day sun, the effect of this factor could not be assessed.\n",
      "While the research indicated the potential benefit of vitamin A in reducing skin cancer risk, its toxicity was also mentioned. Animal-based sources and supplements can push up the blood levels of vitamin A too high, causing nausea, liver derangement, osteoporosis and hip fracture. In pregnant women, it may cause birth defects in the babies. However, plant sources of vitamin A do not usually result in toxicity.\n",
      "This study was observational in nature and so no conclusions can be drawn as to the role of vitamin A in reducing the cancer risk. It suggests that a randomized clinical trial with controls should be carried out to establish that the higher vitamin A intake causes the lower risk. Such a trial will also rule out more confounding factors, such as the effect of less alcohol consumption which might be associated with higher vitamin A intake due to the overlap of these habits in the same group of people.\n",
      "The researchers plan to carry out such a trial to test the preventive efficacy of vitamin A in squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. It is quite difficult to ensure that study participants adhere to the prescribed diet, however, and a failure at this level would make the whole study meaningless. If technical factors make this type of study non-feasible, the best option would be a large prospective study, says Cho.\n",

      "That's according to researchers from Brown University, who unearthed that finding after analyzing data from two long-term observational studies.\n",
      "Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma is the second-most-common type of skin cancer among people with fair skin. Vitamin A is known to be essential for the healthy growth and maturation of skin cells, but prior studies on its effectiveness in reducing skin cancer risk have been mixed, said Eunyoung Cho, an associate professor of dermatology and epidemiology at Brown.\n",

      "Eunyoung Cho, associate epidemiologist, Brigham and Women's Hospital\n",
      "The findings were published on Wednesday, July 31, in the Journal of the American Medical Association Dermatology.\n",
      "The research team led by Cho looked at the diet and skin cancer results of participants in two large, long-term observational studies: the Nurses' Health Study, which followed 121,700 U.S. women from 1984 to 2012, and the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study, which followed 51,529 U.S. men from 1986 to 2012.\n",
      "Between the two studies, some 123,000 participants were white (and thus had significant risk of developing skin cancer), had no prior history of cancer and completed the dietary reports multiple times. Among these individuals included in the team's subsequent analysis, a total of 3,978 cases of squamous cell carcinoma were reported and verified within the 24- or 26-year follow-up periods.\n",
      "Both studies also asked the participants about hair color, the number of severe sunburns they had received in their lifetime and any family history of skin cancer, and the researchers adjusted for these and other factors. The studies did not, however, ask participants about their avoidance of mid-day sun, known to be a major risk factor for skin cancer.\n",
      "After grouping the study participants into five categories by vitamin A intake levels, the researchers found that people in the category with the highest average daily total vitamin A intake were 17 percent less likely to get skin cancer than those in the category with the lowest total vitamin A intake.\n",
      "Those in the highest category reported eating on average the amount of vitamin A equivalent to one medium baked sweet potato or two large carrots each day. Those in the lowest category reported eating a daily average amount of vitamin A equivalent to one-third cup of sweet potato fries or one small carrot, which is still above the U.S. Recommended Dietary Allowance of vitamin A.\n",
      "The team also found that the majority of vitamin A came from the participants' diets, particularly from fruits and vegetables, rather than from animal-based foods or vitamin supplements. Plant-based sources of vitamin A include not only sweet potatoes and carrots, but leafy green vegetables and fruits like apricots and cantaloupe. Milk, some types of fish and liver are rich sources of animal-based vitamin A.\n",
      "Cho cautioned that too much vitamin A, particularly from supplements and animal sources, can lead to nausea, liver toxicity, increased risk of osteoporosis and hip fracture, and even birth defects. Side effects from high levels of plant-based vitamin A are minimal, she added.\n",
      "The researchers also found that eating high levels of other plant-based pigments similar to vitamin A -- such as lycopene, commonly found in tomatoes and watermelon -- was associated with decreased risk of skin cancer.\n",
      "Because the analysis was based on studies surveying a large number of people about the foods they ate and observing whether or not they got skin cancer, rather than a randomized clinical trial, it cannot establish cause and effect. It's possible that another factor may have led to the differences -- such as the fact that people who consumed more vitamin A also tended to drink less alcohol.\n",
      "As a next step, Cho would like to conduct a clinical trial to see if vitamin A supplements can prevent squamous cell carcinoma. However, she added, conducting a dietary clinical trial is quite challenging on a technical level, as is ensuring that participants actually stick to the diet.\n",

      "Increasing the intake of dietary vitamin A may reduce the risk of developing cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), according to a new study recently published in JAMA Dermatology. The study found an inverse association between dietary vitamin A intake and cutaneous SCC risk, suggesting that the vitamin may help to protect against the cancer.\n",
      "“Future studies are needed to determine whether vitamin A supplementation has a role in chemoprevention of SCC,” writes Eunyoung Cho (Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University, Rhode Island) and international collaborators.\n",
      "Maryna Olyak | Shutterstock\n",
      "SCC is a common skin cancer amongst fair-skinned people, with an estimated lifetime incidence among this population of up to 11% in the United States.\n",
      "Well-known risk factors for SCC are age, skin type and exposure to UV rays from sunlight. This type of cancer most commonly develops on areas of skin exposed to the most sunlight such as the head and face.\n",
      "Over recent decades, the incidence of SCC has increased, possibly due to increased life expectancy, greater exposure to sunlight and other lifestyle changes. Prevention and early detection of SCC are vital due to the risk of metastasis.\n",
      "Vitamin A refers to a large group of related compounds called retinoids, bioactive forms of vitamin A that are involved in maintaining epithelial maturation and differentiation. The compounds can be divided into two groups based on the food source they are found in.\n",
      "Vitamin A derived from animals is called retinol, a fat-soluble compound that is the precursor for the most active form of vitamin A – retinoic acid.\n",
      "Vitamin A derived from fruits is known as provitamin A; a carotenoid and includes beta carotene, beta carotene, alpha-carotene, and beta-cryptoxanthin, compounds that the body can be covert into retinol. However, the majority of carotenoids are non-provitamin A and these include lutein, zeaxanthin, and lycopene.\n",
      "As well as retinol being essential for promoting the growth, maintenance and differentiation of epithelial cells, retinoids are involved in regulating gene transcription and introduce changes that could potentially reduce cell growth and help prevent malignancy.\n",
      "Retinoids are also known to block growth-stimulating signals and to trigger multiple downstream signaling pathways that regulate apoptosis and cell differentiation in both cancerous and precancerous lesions.\n",
      "Synthetic retinoids are considered chemopreventative agents and some clinical trials testing their use on nonmelanoma skin cancer (such as SCC) among high-risk populations have found them to be effective.\n",
      "The daily use of synthetic retinoids such as oral acitretin is therefore recommended for the prevention of such cancers among high-risk populations.\n",
      "However, synthetic retinoids are also associated with significant adverse side effects such as high blood cholesterol, liver dysfunction, musculoskeletal pain, headaches and hair loss.\n",
      "Epidemiologic studies of the association between vitamin A or carotenoid intake and SCC risk have been limited and often inconsistent.\n",
      "For example, an analysis of the Nurses’ Health Study (NHS) and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HFPS) found no link between retinol intake and the incidence of SCC incidence. However, the follow-up period was only 14 years among women and 10 years among men, which may not have been sufficient to indicate any benefit of vitamin A, given how slow-growing SCC is.\n",
      "Now, Cho and colleagues have used NHS and HFPS data covering longer follow-up periods (1984-2012 and 1986-2012, respectively) and larger sample size to reassess the association between intakes of vitamin A, retinol, and carotenoids and the risk of developing SCC.\n",
      "Among the 75,170 women (mean age 50.4 years) in the NHS and 48,400 men (mean age 54.3 years) in the HPFS, 3,978 cases of SCC were documented.\n",
      "Cho and team report that an increased total intake of vitamin A intake was associated with a decrease in SCC risk.\n",
      "Compared with the lowest quintile for vitamin A intake (quintile 1), the pooled multivariate hazard ratios for the increasing quintiles of vitamin A intake were 0.97 for quintiles 2 and 3, falling to 0.93 for quintile 4 and 0.83 for quintile 5.\n",
      "An increased intake of retinol and some carotenoids was also associated with a decrease in the risk for SCC. The pooled HRs for the highest versus lowest quintiles of intake were 0.88 for total retinol, 0.86 for beta-cryptoxanthin, 0.87 for lycopene, and 0.89 for lutein and zeaxanthin.\n",
      "The results were generally consistent between men and women, but the inverse associations seemed to be more prominent among people with moles, burns or those who had experienced a blistering sunburn reaction as children or adolescents.\n",
      "The authors suggest that since the synthetic retinoids used in chemoprevention of SCC in high-risk populations are associated with adverse health effects, dietary vitamin A could be investigated as an alternative in both high-risk and general populations.\n",
      "However, they also point out that while an increased vitamin A intake be effective as a chemopreventative agent for skin cancer, its high intake could also be associated adverse health effects such as an increased risk for osteoporosis or hip fracture.\n",
      "The team concludes:\n",
      "More research is needed to understand the appropriate level of vitamin A intake for maximum health benefits. Therefore, risks and benefits of high vitamin A intake should be considered individually.”\n",

      "Measles virus infection leads to rise in viral counts and fall in the lymphocyte counts in the body. The authors wrote, “Lymphocyte counts recover shortly after the disappearance of measles-associated rash, but immunosuppression can persist for months to years after infection, resulting in increased incidence of secondary infections.”\n",
      "Researchers have found that measles virus can damage the immune system of the body and make it forget the microbes it knows. They explain, that the immune system acts as an army within the body. When they encounter a microbe – bacteria, or virus, it recognizes the organism and stores the memory of the bug. When the same microbe attacks again, the immune system from its memory rises to fight off the infection. This is the principle of a vaccine where the body is presented with a weakened or dead version of the microbe so that its memory of the organism is created. When a person is infected with measles, the virus can make the immune system forget its memories of other organisms as well. This is called immune-amnesia and makes a person vulnerable to infections he or she was earlier immune to.\n",
      "According to evidence in scientific research measles virus can cause immune amnesia that can last for up to two to three years. The team from Harvard Medical School, Brigham and Women's Hospital and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health studied the effect of measles virus on the immune system in their latest study. They noted that measles virus is capable of erasing 11 to 73 percent of the memories of the immune system or antibodies that can protect the body against infections. For example, if a person has had chicken pox before, there is likelihood that he or she would not get the infection again. This could be because of the 100 different antibodies circulating within his or her body. The measles virus infection however could bring down the levels of these antibodies to half and that may raise the risk of his or her getting infected with chicken pox virus.\n",
      "First author of the study, Michael Mina, formerly a postdoctoral researcher in the laboratory of Stephen Elledge at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital and now an assistant professor of epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said in a statement explaining, “Imagine that your immunity against pathogens is like carrying around a book of photographs of criminals, and someone punched a bunch of holes in it. It would then be much harder to recognize that criminal if you saw them, especially if the holes are punched over important features for recognition, like the eyes or mouth.”\n",
      "Lead author Stephen Elledge, the Gregor Mendel Professor of Genetics and of Medicine in the Blavatnik Institute at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital added, “The threat measles poses to people is much greater than we previously imagined. We now understand the mechanism is a prolonged danger due to erasure of the immune memory, demonstrating that the measles vaccine is of even greater benefit than we knew.”\n",
      "Mina had found in a study in 2015 that measles during childhood could significantly raise the risk of later illness and deaths. She said, “This is the best evidence yet that immune amnesia exists and impacts our bona fide long-term immune memory.”\n",
      "In a related paper in the Science Immunology (2), titled, “Incomplete genetic reconstitution of B cell pools contributes to prolonged immunosuppression after measles,” lead author Velislava Petrova of the Wellcome Sanger Institute and team looked at the genes of the immune memory cells in the body to see the effects of the measles virus on these cells. Petrova said, “The immune cells that normally would recognize new pathogens — they become restricted in their ability to respond.” He added, “What was interesting is that we can recover our normal cell counts, but we're still immunosuppressed.”\n",
      "In an accompanying editorial in the journal Science Immunology (3), written by Duane Wesemann, Harvard Medical School assistant professor of medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital, put the present study in context of what was happening around the world – i.e. the measles outbreaks among the unvaccinated.\n",
      "According to the researchers of the Science study, it may take a few years before the immune memories come back after a bout of measles infection. They add that this is an important consideration for physicians if they should provide a round of booster doses of vaccines for other infections such as polio and hepatitis to children who have had measles, in order to circumvent the immune amnesia. They wrote, “Revaccination following measles could help to mitigate long-term suffering that might stem from immune amnesia and the increased susceptibility to other infections.”\n",
      "Elledge and Tomasz Kula, a PhD student in the Elledge Lab, had developed a tool called VirScan in 2015 that helped them understand the effects of the virus on the immune system in 2015. This tool helped detect the antibodies against the viruses and bacteria the immune system has previous encountered explained the researchers. Study author Rik de Swart, for this study obtained blood samples from children who had not been vaccinated in the 2013 outbreak of measles in Netherlands.\n",
      "In the study the team used VirScan to measure the levels of the antibodies before a measles attack a two months after an attack of measles. They used 77 samples from infected children for their experiment and compared them with 115 samples from children and adults who had never had measles. According to Kula, there was a sharp drop in the antibodies for other microbes in the blood of the measles infected children and this showed the effect of the measles virus on the immune system. Elledge said, “This proved to be the first definitive evidence that measles affects the levels of protective antibodies themselves, providing a mechanism supporting immune amnesia.” The authors wrote, “Memory B cell clones present before infection were depleted in post-measles samples even after lymphocyte counts had recovered.”\n",
      "Following this the team then worked with Diane Griffin at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and measured the levels of antibodies four rhesus macaques or monkeys. The levels of antibodies were measured before measles infection and five months after it. Macaques are similar to humans and thus this longer time study yielded results that were more robust explain the researchers. The results showed that the macaques also lost an average of 40 to 60 percent of the antibodies to the viruses and bacteria that the monkeys were exposed before.\n",
      "The team warned that this loss of the immune system after measles infection could be a particular danger for some populations of children and adults. For example among malnourished children and children and adults with immune deficiency, the risk is greater. Elledge said, “The average kid might emerge from measles with a dent in their immune system and their body will be able to handle that. But kids on the edge--such as those with severe measles infection or immune deficiencies or those who are malnourished--will be in serious trouble.”\n",
      "Mina said in conclusion, “This drives home the importance of understanding and preventing the long-term effects of measles, including stealth effects that have flown under the radar of doctors and parents. If your child gets the measles and then gets pneumonia two years later, you wouldn't necessarily tie the two together. The symptoms of measles itself may be only the tip of the iceberg.”\n",
      "Wesemann who wrote the accompanying editorial said, “You get the best of both worlds with the vaccine.” He added, “You get the robust immunity against measles virus without having to be infected with it, but it doesn't cause the immune damage that the real measles virus causes. The measles vaccine is really a superhero.”\n",
      "\n",
      "----------------------------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "Over the last decade, evidence has mounted that the measles vaccine protects in not one but two ways: Not only does it prevent the well-known acute illness with spots and fever that frequently sends children to the hospital, but it also appears to protect from other infections over the long term.\n",
      "How does this work? Some researchers have suggested that the vaccine gives a general boost to the immune system.\n",
      "Others have hypothesized that the vaccine's extended protective effects stem from preventing measles infection itself. According to this theory, the virus can impair the body's immune memory, causing so-called immune amnesia. By protecting against measles infection, the vaccine prevents the body from losing or \"forgetting\" its immune memory and preserves its resistance to other infections.\n",
      "Past research hinted at the effects of immune amnesia, showing that immune suppression following measles infection could last as long as two to three years.\n",
      "However, many scientists still debate which hypothesis is correct. Among the critical questions are: If immune amnesia is real, how exactly does it happen, and how severe is it?\n",
      "Now, a study from an international team of researchers led by investigators at Harvard Medical School, Brigham and Women's Hospital and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health provides much-needed answers.\n",
      "Reporting Oct. 31 in Science, the researchers show that the measles virus wipes out 11 percent to 73 percent of the different antibodies that protect against viral and bacterial strains a person was previously immune to-;anything from influenza to herpesvirus to bacteria that cause pneumonia and skin infections.\n",
      "So, if a person had 100 different antibodies against chicken pox before contracting measles, they might emerge from having measles with only 50, cutting their chicken pox protection in half. That protection could dip even lower if some of the antibodies lost are potent defenses known as neutralizing antibodies.\n",
      "Imagine that your immunity against pathogens is like carrying around a book of photographs of criminals, and someone punched a bunch of holes in it. It would then be much harder to recognize that criminal if you saw them, especially if the holes are punched over important features for recognition, like the eyes or mouth.\"\n",
      "Michael Mina, study's first author, postdoctoral researcher in the laboratory of Stephen Elledge at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital at the time of the study, now assistant professor of epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health\n",
      "The study is the first to measure the immune damage caused by the virus and underscores the value of preventing measles infection through vaccination, the authors said.\n",
      "\"The threat measles poses to people is much greater than we previously imagined,\" said senior author Stephen Elledge, the Gregor Mendel Professor of Genetics and of Medicine in the Blavatnik Institute at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital. \"We now understand the mechanism is a prolonged danger due to erasure of the immune memory, demonstrating that the measles vaccine is of even greater benefit than we knew.\"\n",
      "The discovery that measles depletes people's antibody repertoires, partially obliterating immune memory to most previously encountered pathogens, supports the immune amnesia hypothesis.\n",
      "\"This is the best evidence yet that immune amnesia exists and impacts our bona fide long-term immune memory,\" added Mina, who first discovered the epidemiological effects of measles on long-term childhood mortality in a 2015 paper.\n",
      "The team's current work was published simultaneously with a paper by a separate team in Science Immunology that reached complementary conclusions by measuring changes in B cells caused by the measles virus. An accompanying editorial in Science Immunology, written by Duane Wesemann, Harvard Medical School assistant professor of medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital, contextualizes that study.\n",
      "Elledge, Mina and colleagues found that those who survive measles gradually regain their previous immunity to other viruses and bacteria as they get re-exposed to them. But because this process may take months to years, people remain vulnerable in the meantime to serious complications of those infections.\n",
      "In light of this finding, the researchers say clinicians may want to consider strengthening the immunity of patients recovering from measles infection with a round of booster shots of all previous routine vaccines, such as hepatitis and polio.\n",
      "\"Revaccination following measles could help to mitigate long-term suffering that might stem from immune amnesia and the increased susceptibility to other infections,\" the authors said.\n",
      "One of the most contagious diseases known to humankind, measles killed an average of 2.6 million people each year before a vaccine was developed, according to the World Health Organization. Widespread vaccination has slashed the death toll.\n",
      "However, lack of access to vaccination and refusal to get vaccinated means measles still infects more than 7 million people and kills more than 100,000 each year worldwide, reports the WHO-;and cases are on the rise, tripling in early 2019. About 20 percent of people in the U.S. who get infected with measles require hospitalization, according to the CDC, and some experience well-known long-term consequences, including brain damage and vision and hearing loss.\n",
      "Previous epidemiological research into immune amnesia suggests that death rates attributed to measles could be even higher-;accounting for as much as 50 percent of all childhood mortality-;if researchers factored in deaths caused by infections resulting from measles' ravaging effects on immunity.\n",
      "This new discovery was made possible thanks to VirScan, a tool Elledge and Tomasz Kula, a PhD student in the Elledge Lab, developed in 2015.\n",
      "VirScan detects antiviral and antibacterial antibodies in the blood that result from current or past encounters with viruses and bacteria, giving an overall snapshot of the immune system.\n",
      "Study co-author Rik de Swart had gathered blood samples from unvaccinated children during a 2013 measles outbreak in the Netherlands. For the new study, Elledge's group used VirScan to measure antibodies before and two months after infection in 77 children from de Swart's samples who'd contracted the disease. The researchers also compared the measurements to those of 115 uninfected children and adults.\n",
      "When Kula examined an initial set of these samples, he found a striking drop in antibodies from other pathogens in the measles-infected children that \"clearly suggested a direct effect on the immune system,\" the authors said.\n",
      "The effect resembled what Mina had hypothesized could drive measles-induced immune amnesia.\n",
      "\"This proved to be the first definitive evidence that measles affects the levels of protective antibodies themselves, providing a mechanism supporting immune amnesia,\" said Elledge.\n",
      "Then, in collaboration with Diane Griffin at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, the team measured antibodies in four rhesus macaques-;monkeys closely related to humans-;before and five months after measles infection. This covered a much longer period post-infection than what was available in the Netherlands samples.\n",
      "Similar to the findings in people, the macaques lost an average of 40 to 60 percent of their preexisting antibodies to the viruses and bacteria they had been previously exposed to.\n",
      "Further tests revealed that severe measles infection reduced people's overall immunity more than mild infection. This could be particularly problematic for certain categories of children and adults, the researchers said.\n",
      "The authors stress that the effects observed in the current study occurred in previously healthy children. Because measles is known to hit malnourished children much harder, the degree of immune amnesia and its effects could be even more severe in less healthy populations.\n",
      "\"The average kid might emerge from measles with a dent in their immune system and their body will be able to handle that,\" said Elledge. \"But kids on the edge-;such as those with severe measles infection or immune deficiencies or those who are malnourished-;will be in serious trouble.\"\n",
      "Inoculation with the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine did not impair children's overall immunity, the researchers found. The results align with decades of research.\n",
      "Ensuring widespread vaccination against measles would not only help prevent the 120,000 deaths that will be directly attributed to measles this year alone but could also avert potentially hundreds of thousands of additional deaths attributable to the lasting damage to the immune system, the authors said.\n",
      "\"This drives home the importance of understanding and preventing the long-term effects of measles, including stealth effects that have flown under the radar of doctors and parents,\" said Mina. \"If your child gets the measles and then gets pneumonia two years later, you wouldn't necessarily tie the two together.

      "When Elyse Imamura's son was an infant, she and her husband, Robert, chose to spread out his vaccinations at a more gradual pace than the official schedule recommended.\n",
      "\"I was thinking, 'OK, we're going to do this,'\" says Imamura, 39, of Torrance, Calif. \"'But we're going to do it slower so your body gets acclimated and doesn't face six different things all of a sudden.'\"\n",
      "Seven years later, Imamura says her son, Amaru, is a \"very healthy,\" active boy who loves to play sports.\n",
      "But delaying vaccines is risky. Many pediatricians will tell you a more gradual approach to vaccinations is better than no vaccinations at all, but they offer some hard advice to parents who are considering it.\n",
      "\"Every day you are eligible to get a vaccine that you don't get one, the chance of an invasive disease remains,\" says Dr. Charles Golden, executive medical director of the Primary Care Network at Children's Hospital of Orange County.\n",
      "Recent outbreaks of measles, mumps and whooping cough have once again reignited a war of words over vaccinations.\n",
      "The squabble is often painted as two-sided: in one camp, the medical establishment, backed by science, strongly promoting the vaccination of children against 14 childhood diseases by age 2. In the other, a small but vocal minority — the so-called anti-vaxxers — shunning the shots, believing the risks of vaccines outweigh the dangers of the diseases.\n",
      "The notion that there are two opposing sides obscures a large middle ground occupied by up to one-quarter of parents, who believe in vaccinating their children but, like the Imamuras, choose to do so more gradually. They worry about the health impact of so many shots in so short a period, and in some cases they forgo certain vaccines entirely.\n",
      "Alternative vaccine schedules have been around for years, promoted by a few doctors and touted by celebrities such as Jenny McCarthy. Donald Trump endorsed the idea during a 2015 Republican presidential debate.\n",
      "The concept gained a large following more than a decade ago, when Robert W. Sears, an Orange County, Calif., pediatrician, published \"The Vaccine Book,\" in which he included two alternative schedules. Both delay vaccines, and one of them also allows parents to skip shots for measles, mumps and rubella (MMR), chickenpox, hepatitis A and polio.\n",
      "Sears' book became the vaccination bible for thousands of parents, who visited their pediatricians with it in tow. But his ideas have been widely rejected by the medical establishment and he was punished by the Medical Board of California last year after it accused him of improperly exempting a 2-year-old from all future vaccinations. He declined to be interviewed for this column.\n",
      "Imamura, who describes herself as \"definitely not an anti-vaxxer,\" says she and her husband \"followed Sears to a T.\" They limited the number of vaccines for their son to no more than two per appointment, compared with up to six in the official schedule. And they skipped the shot for chickenpox.\n",
      "She concedes, however: \"If there'd been outbreaks like now, it would have affected my thinking about delaying vaccines.\"\n",
      "The ideas promoted by Sears and others have contributed to parents' worries that front-loading shots could overwhelm their babies' immune systems or expose them to toxic levels of chemicals such as mercury, aluminum and formaldehyde.\n",
      "But scientific evidence does not support that. Infectious-disease doctors and public health officials say everyday life presents far greater challenges to children's immune systems.\n",
      "\"Touching another human being, crawling around the house, they are exposed to so many things all the time on a daily basis, so these vaccines don't add much to that,\" says Dr. Pia Pannaraj, a pediatric infectious-diseases specialist at Children's Hospital Los Angeles.\n",
      "The same is true of some of the metals and chemicals contained in vaccines, which vaccination skeptics blame for autism despite numerous studies finding no link — the most recent published earlier this month.\n",
      "In the first six months of life, babies get far more aluminum from breast milk and infant formula than from vaccines, public health experts say.\n",
      "\"When you look at babies that have received aluminum-containing vaccines, you can't even tell the level has gone up,\" says Paul Offit, professor of pediatrics at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) and director of the hospital's Vaccine Education Center. The same is true of formaldehyde and mercury, he adds.\n",
      "(Offit co-invented Merck's RotaTeq vaccine for rotavirus, and CHOP sold the royalty rights to it for $182 million in 2008. CHOP declined to comment on what Offit's share was.)\n",
      "Parents who are concerned about mercury, aluminum or other vaccine ingredients should avoid information shared on social media, which can be misleading. Instead, check out the Vaccine Education Center on CHOP's website at www.chop.edu by clicking on the \"Departments\" tab.\n",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also provides a detailed breakdown of the ingredients in every vaccine at http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines.\n",
      "If your child has a condition you fear might be incompatible with vaccinations, discuss it with your pediatrician. The CDC gives very specific guidelines on who should not receive vaccines, including kids who have immune system deficiencies or are getting chemotherapy or taking certain medications.\n",
      "If your children are not among them, vaccinate them. That will help prevent outbreaks, protecting those who, for medical reasons, have not received the shots.\n",
      "When parents resist, Pannaraj says, she emphasizes that the potential harm from infections is far more severe than the risks of the vaccines. She notes, for example, that the risk of getting encephalitis from the measles is about 1,000 times greater than from the vaccine.\n",
      "Still, side effects do occur. Most are mild, but severe cases — though rare — are not unheard of. To learn about the potential side effects of vaccines, look on the CDC website or discuss it with your pediatrician.\n",
      "Emily Lawrence Mendoza, 35, says that after her second child, Elsie, got her first measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) shot at 12 months of age, she spiked a fever and developed a full body rash that looked like a mild version of the disease.\n",
      "It took three visits to urgent care before a doctor acknowledged that Elsie, now almost 5, could have had a mild reaction to the vaccine. After that, Mendoza, of Orange, Calif., decided to adopt a more gradual vaccination schedule for her third child.\n",
      "Yet Mendoza says Elsie's adverse reaction made her realize the importance of vaccinations: \"What if she'd been exposed to a full-blown case of the measles?\"\n",

      "Finally the verdict is out. A large study has proven conclusively that there is no association between Measles Mumps and Rubella combined vaccine or the MMR vaccine and autism. The results of the landmark study were published in the latest issue of the Annals of Internal Medicine.\n",
      "Anti-vaccination advocates have publicized and deterred millions of parents from vaccinating their children against these three vaccine-preventable viral infections for the last few decades for fear of their causing autism. This new research proves such fears as baseless. Due to such fears and inadequate vaccine coverage there has been a 30 percent rise in number of cases of measles across the world. The World Health Organization (WHO) has listed anti-vaxxer or anti-vaccination campaigns as one of the top ten health threats in 2019.\n",
      "The Danish team included over 650,000 children who were followed up and it was noted that the MMR vaccine did not lead to any developmental abnormalities and problems with social skills, communication and interactive capabilities of the children.\n",
      "The doubts about the connection between the MMR vaccine and autism began after a research paper from discredited former physician Andrew Wakefield in 1998. He had claimed that there was this association without scientific evidence and the theory had been completely disproved later. This new study was another major attempt to substantiate the claim that there was indeed no association between the vaccine and autism.\n",
      "Lead study author Dr Anders Hviid of the Statens Serum Institute warned parents to not skip the vaccine and said that there remained a risk of resurgence of the diseases like measles if there was inadequate vaccination. The team followed the huge number of children (657,461 children) from birth up to the age of 14. Results showed that around 1 percent of the children (6,517 children) developed autism. The rates of autism were similar among the vaccinated as well as non-vaccinated children, they explained. This means that there was no connection between the vaccine and autism, they write.\n",
      "The researchers also conducted a key study to disprove the MMR vaccine and autism link in back in 2002. Dr. Hviid said, “That [2002 study] was published in the New England Journal of Medicine 16 years ago, but it hasn’t dispelled this idea that vaccination causes autism. I remember a couple of years ago we even saw Donald Trump in his presidential campaign tweet about vaccines causing autism.”\n",
      "Healthy young child goes to doctor, gets pumped with massive shot of many vaccines, doesn't feel good and changes - AUTISM. Many such cases!\n",
      "Dr Saad Omer and Dr Inci Yildirim from Emory University wrote an accompanying editorial saying that it was important that such a large study was carried out to reiterate the safety of the vaccines. “In an ideal world, vaccine safety research would be conducted only to evaluate scientifically grounded hypotheses, not in response to the conspiracy du jour…In reality, hypotheses propagated by vaccine sceptics can affect public confidence in vaccines,” they wrote.”\n",

      " Chances are, you've made a few midnight raids on the fridge — most people have. But is there any harm in making your nighttime snack a regular habit? Even experts haven't found a clear answer to that question. \n",
      " \"The effects of nighttime eating can differ based on personal characteristics and on the type and amount of food being consumed,\" says  Dr. Sarah Musleh  , endocrinologist at  Anzara Health  — so, it's hard to provide a simple answer, like \"It's good\" or \"It's bad.\" \n",
      " According to Musleh, some research connects nighttime eating to potentially negative health effects, such as: \n",
      " But if you can't sleep on an empty stomach, here's some good news: Some evidence  suggests what you eat matters more than the timing  . \n",
      " Below, you'll find four important things to keep in mind about late-night eating, along with tips on snacking wisely throughout the day to reduce nighttime hunger. \n",
      " Some foods and beverages may have more of an  impact on your sleep and digestion  than others: \n",
      " To sum up, a bedtime latte with a side of spicy chips might not be the best choice when you feel like a quick snack before bed. \n",
      " Beyond the type of food you eat, portion size can also make a difference in the effects of late-night eating. \n",
      " A bigger snack before bed  can raise your blood sugar  — and higher blood sugar levels may  contribute to insomnia  . \n",
      " \"Our body was not designed to digest large meals during sleep, particularly carbohydrates and sugar,\" says Carleara Weiss,  member of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine  and  sleep educator at Aeroflow Sleep  . Heavy meals take more effort for your body to digest, which Weiss says could impair your sleep if eaten too close to bedtime. \n",
      " In short, a four-course pantry buffet just before bed could leave you lying awake instead of getting the rest you need. \n",
      " Quick tip:  Sticking to smaller snack portions, like a handful of nuts with a glass of milk, could satisfy you without making you feel too full to sleep. \n",
      " The timing of your nighttime snack also plays a key role, thanks to your  circadian rhythm  . \n",
      " The circadian rhythm is an internal process that controls your  sleep-wake cycle  . Think of it like your body's 24-hour clock. Typically, it's  synched up with the day-night cycle  , so you feel sleepy at night and awake during the day. But eating too close to bed might throw you off your rhythm. \n",
      " \"Eating close to bedtime, regardless of the food of choice, will disrupt the circadian rhythm because our digestion needs to slow down during sleep,\" Weiss says. \n",
      " For that reason, it may help to stop eating within a set window before bed — though the exact time you'll want to have your last meal of the day depends on your individual bedtime. \n",
      " Quick tip:  Weiss recommends eating your last meal or snack two to three hours before bed. This will give your body enough time to properly digest your food and transition into sleep mode. So, if you typically hop into bed at 10 pm, aim to close up the kitchen no later than 8 pm. \n",
      " The last piece of the puzzle is  physical activity  , though experts continue to study the link between exercise and hunger. \n",
      " Some research suggests a more intense workout  might suppress your hunger hormones  , which could mean a hard workout during the day may leave you less hungry at night. \n",
      " That said,  Tom Holland  , exercise physiologist and fitness expert, emphasizes that experts have found mixed results on the effects of exercise on hunger: \n",
      " In short, there's no conclusive answer, but some trial and error can help you find out what works for you: Experts recommend exercising for  around 150 minutes every week  , if you're able —  around 30 minutes a day, five days per week. \n",
      " Holland says the  best time to work out  for better sleep can also vary. Some older evidence suggests that intense exercise before bed  could disrupt sleep  , yet other research suggests people who exercise late in the day may enjoy  deeper, more restful sleep  . \n",
      " \"The key is to listen to your body and determine how exercise affects you personally, then adjust accordingly,\" Holland says. \n",
      " Quick tip:  If you're prone to feeling hungrier after exercise, Holland recommends refueling with a  snack containing complex carbs and protein  , like a  protein bar  or shake. If you work out later in the day, refueling with a  sleep-boosting snack  could also improve your rest. \n",
      " Paying attention to your daytime routine can help you stave off nighttime hunger. For example, you might try: \n",
      " If you need to eat something before bed, it could help to  choose foods associated with better sleep  , Lustig says. Examples include: \n",
      " No conclusive evidence suggests eating at night is automatically harmful to your health — but eating certain foods before bed may disrupt your sleep. \n",
      " In general, experts recommend eating your last meal or snack at least two to three hours before bed to give your body time to digest. If you can't skip your nighttime snack, opting for one with more sleep-friendly compounds could make a difference — for instance, kiwi and plain yogurt instead of a candy bar or jalapeno nachos. \n",
      " Making a few adjustments to your daytime meals and snacks could also help prevent late-night hunger pangs in the first place. \n",

      " Eating foods that help you sleep can make a major difference to the amount of rest you get and may even speed up the time it takes to drop off at night. In fact, eating a balanced diet overall goes hand in hand with quality sleep. \n",
      " So why do we need good sleep? According to registered dietitian Monique Richard, a spokesperson for the  Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics  and owner of Nutrition-In-Sight, “adequate and sufficient quality sleep is essential for the recovery of our systems through cellular turnover and a variety of molecular processes that happen while we are at rest”. \n",
      " “Quality sleep allows cognitive function to be restored – according to the journal  Cerebrum  – for muscles to recover and for the accumulated toxins and byproducts to be cleared out,” she adds. “It also supports emotional and mood stability. Put simply, it is essential for physiological and psychological processes.” \n",
      " By contrast, poor-quality sleep can affect our circadian rhythm: the body’s internal clock. Richards says that this can lead to higher cortisol (stress hormone) levels, which in turn can affect blood glucose regulation, altering energy levels and how the body stores energy. \n",
      " And when you’re tired, the appetite-regulating hormones ghrelin and leptin can be affected, affecting food choices, as well as how much and how often you eat. \n",
      " “Often, to combat fatigue, more 'instant gratification' choices are made, such as stimulants like coffee or foods higher in fat, sugar and/or salt,” Richardson adds. “These can impact weight management, blood glucose regulation, or further deplete energy stores, making us more tired.” \n",
      " It’s clear that good-quality sleep is crucial for overall health and wellbeing. As well as trying the  best magnesium supplements  to help you relax and unwind, read on to find out the best foods that have sleep-boosting properties. \n",
      " Different foods can affect the quality of sleep for better or worse, but your genetic and physiological make-up and other variables will also have an impact, says Richard. \n",
      " “Large amounts of saturated fat may affect sleep duration and overall sleep wellness — think meats, pizza, fast food, processed foods, desserts, pre-prepared meals and baked goods,” she says. \n",
      " Monique Richard is a licensed dietitian and nutritionist with a Master of Science degree in Clinical Nutrition and minor in Psychology. She is a National Media Spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and the owner of Nutrition-In-Sight in Johnson City, where she offers nutrition communication, counseling and consulting services. \n",
      " Alcohol can initially cause a relaxing effect, and often reduces the time it takes to fall asleep. However, according to the journal  Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research  , it can then lead to disruptive sleep patterns with significantly reduced REM sleep. Richard says this stage is important for dreaming, memory, emotional processing and healthy brain development. \n",
      " She adds: “Sleep quality and quantity also seems to be compromised from excess caffeine intake. In fact, for some, any caffeine, depending on how sensitive they are and their genetic disposition will be problematic. And it’s not just coffee, but coffee drinks, as well as chocolate and energy drinks that can cause problems. \n",
      " “  Caffeine reduces an enzyme  – 6-sulfatoxymelatonin – that can affect the role of  melatonin  : the hormone that helps control your sleep cycle, interrupting how much rest you get that night.” \n",
      "\n",
      " Carbohydrates can also interfere with sleep patterns. “  Higher glycemic index foods  , including white sugar, syrups, cakes and candies may be associated with  insomnia  , while high-fiber carbs, such as whole-grains, vegetables, beans, nuts, seeds and various fruit were associated with lower risk and prevalence of insomnia,” says Richard. \n",
      " Refined carbs spike your blood sugar, which results in an insulin response that can lower blood sugar levels enough to produce more of the hormones that wake you up, such as large amino acids tryptophan. Spicy foods may disrupt sleep, cause  acid reflux  or be irritating to the esophagus and digestive tract. \n",
      " By contrast, some foods and drinks have compounds that help regulate parts of the sleep cycle, while others have certain antioxidants and nutrients, such as magnesium and melatonin, that have sleep-enhancing properties. \n",
      " If you are looking for foods that help you sleep, then eating some of the below, two to three hours for bedtime, could help. \n",
      " Fatty fish, like salmon, are full of omega-3 and  vitamin D  , two nutrients that help regulate serotonin. As well as happiness, this neurotransmitter is responsible for establishing a regular sleep-wake cycle. \n",
      "\n",
      " Tart cherries increase the sleep hormone melatonin, which is produced naturally in the body by the brain’s pineal gland. “Tart cherries make a good after dinner snack to help induce preparedness for a good night’s sleep,” says Richard. If you can’t get hold of them, they can be taken in juice form or as a supplement. \n",
      " While the  research  on micronutrients and sleep is limited, it has found specific foods, beverages, ingredients or nutrients that have greater impacts on sleep quality and duration. \n",
      " Walnuts are rich in omega-3 fatty acids that can assist in melatonin rhythm and circadian rhythm clock functions. \n",
      "\n",
      " Oats are a plant source of the amino acid tryptophan, which “contributes to the melatonin and serotonin pathway, which can promote good quality sleep,” says Richard. \n",
      " “Vitamins D,  C  , B6,  B12  , calcium and relaxing magnesium found in dairy – as well as fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds and fortified foods – can contribute to better sleep,” says Richard. \n",
      "\n",
      " “However, it’s important to keep in mind ‘big picture' thinking for overall long-term quality of sleep,” she says. “For example, looking at lifestyle as a whole: whether it is a  Mediterranean diet  lifestyle,  DASH diet  or similar, the fundamentals of adequate amounts of lean protein, quality fats and complex carbohydrates paired with colorful fruits and vegetables rich in  antioxidants  and phytochemicals are essential, along with overall gut health and movement. \n",
      " “A culmination of all the nutrients above is imperative to meet the needs of each of our metabolic pathways and recovery systems during adequate sleep,” says Richard. “Adequate hydration, sleep hygiene, reduction of screen time hours before bed, comfortable bedding and clothing, a cool room and soothing bedtime routine – plus stress management habits and consistent routines – will play pivotal roles in overall sleep quality. Incorporating a calming ‘decompression practice’ such as yoga, reading, journaling or meditation, may also be beneficial for better sleep.” \n",

      "As a Malaysian, I’m surprised that Malaysia is one of the top countries whose people believe vaccines cause autism (Figure 1). Perhaps we are just not as vocal in voicing this issue, giving the illusion that vaccine hesitancy isn’t prevalent here.\n",
      "The Ipsos Mori Perils of Perception Survey conducted 29,133 interviews across 38 countries in 2017. They revealed that 8–44% of people believed vaccines caused autism in children, 23–63% were unsure, and only 20–62% did not believe it. If you average them, nearly 6 in 10 people worldwide were unsure or believed that vaccines cause autism (Figure 1).\n",
      "No wonder the World Health Organization (WHO) named vaccine hesitancy as one of the top 10 threats to public health in 2019.\n",
      "Why do people still believe that vaccines cause autism? As a science graduate, I was under the impression that this belief has been widely debunked. But I didn’t read into the details, and perhaps there might be a reason for this belief to sustain to this day.\n",
      "Autism spectrum disorder (autism) is a life-long neurodevelopmental condition that occurs in childhood due to certain brain changes. It affects 1–2% of children worldwide, about 4-times more often in boys than girls, likely due to how different sex hormones affect brain development.\n",
      "The main symptoms are impaired social communication and restricted, repetitive behaviors, which are problematic enough to impair daily activities. People with autism may also face delayed developmental skills in language, movement, cognition, and behavioral and emotional control.\n",
      "Only with the publication of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, third edition (DSM-III), in the early 1980s, was autism professionally defined. Before that, autism was thought of as childhood schizophrenia, mental retardation, or mere bizarre behaviors.\n",
      "The cause of autism remains unclear. A combination of genetic, sex, maternal, childbirth, and environmental factors are known risk factors of autism, but the precise contribution of each factor is still ambiguous.\n",
      "This autism-vaccine belief began with a 1998 scientific paper, which, though retracted in 2010, still prevails as the founding proof of vaccines causing autism. Let’s see what the 1998 paper has to say.\n",
      "Andrew J. Wakefield, a former physician, and colleagues had their paper, “Ileal-lymphoid-nodular hyperplasia, non-specific colitis, and pervasive developmental disorder in children,” published in The Lancet in 1998, which was retracted as late as 2010. Wakefield was the lead investigator of the paper. And The Lancet is a highly prestigious journal to this day.\n",
      "The paper was a case series of 12 children with a history of developmental disorder (loss of acquired skills) and intestinal symptoms (diarrhea, abdominal pain, bloating, and food intolerance). Several tests were performed, such as vaccination history, bloodwork, ileocolonoscopy, brain scans, and neuropsychiatric assessments.\n",
      "A history of the MMR (mumps, measles, and rubella) vaccine was identified in eight of the children before their behavioral problems began. Five of them had an early adverse reaction to the vaccine, such as rash, fever, delirium, and convulsion). And the average time from vaccination to the occurrence of behavioral symptoms was 6.3 days (range: 1–14 days). The MMR vaccine was thus linked to autism and other developmental conditions by either the child’s physician or parents.\n",
      "Next, ileocolonoscopy revealed several abnormalities in the intestines, such as hyperplasia (tissue enlargement), loss of vascularity, and infiltration of inflammatory immune cells.\n",
      "Wakefield et al. then cited the opioid excess theory of autism first proposed in 1979, where opioid peptides produced from the metabolism of gluten and casein are leaked into the bloodstream due to a leaky gut. Such opioid peptides then act on opioid receptors of the brain, altering neurotransmission and causing autistic symptoms.\n",
      "Wakefield et al. also cited Thompson et al.’s study in 1995, which reported higher rates of inflammatory bowel disease in individuals who got the live measle virus vaccine compared to those who didn’t.\n",
      "Linking the two led Wakefield et al. to conclude that the MMR vaccine inflames the intestines, resulting in a leaky gut and leaked opioids, which dysregulate brain neurotransmission and cause autism.\n",
      "However, the opioid excess theory of autism — which forms the crux of Wakefield’s vaccine-autism link — was discredited in later years.\n",
      "At least two studies from the U.K., in 2007 and 2008, found no differences in urinary opioid markers between children with and without autism. “These findings are counter to the putative mechanism of the leaky gut syndrome,” authors of the 2008 study wrote. “There is now a large body of work which refutes the theory and cannot replicate the findings.”\n",
      "As follows, a 2009 systematic review of 14 studies from the U.S. did not support the use of gluten-free or casein-free diets (GFCF) in treating autism. “The data from these studies do not support the Opioid-Excess Theory,” the review authors wrote. “Until conclusive evidence is found in support of GFCF diets, restrictive diets should only be implemented in the event a food allergy or intolerance is detected.”\n",
      "If the opioid excess theory of autism is invalid, the presumed mechanism of the MMR vaccine causing leaky gut and subsequent autism also becomes invalid. Now, the causative link between the MMR vaccine, inflamed and leaky gut, and autism crumbles.\n",
      "Even Thompson et al.’s (1995) paper that Wakefield et al. relied on was flawed. Thompson et al. reported higher rates of inflammatory bowel disease in children who received the live measle virus vaccine than children who didn’t. But scientists had criticized that the unvaccinated children (controls) came from a different cohort — from a child-health study conducted before measles vaccines were available. Recruitment and follow-up methods, as well as baseline characteristics, were different between the two cohorts, rendering their comparison invalid. Plus, Wakefield himself co-authored this study.\n",
      "Moreover, Wakefield et al.’s 1998 paper was a case series of 12 children. A case series is just a compilation of case reports, which by themselves are weak evidence. By right, case series or reports serve to generate new hypotheses for further studies in larger cohorts. After the 1998 paper was published, Wakefield refused to conduct additional studies to support his findings, despite being aware of the allegations against his paper.\n",
      "In later years, more studies were conducted on the vaccine-autism link, finding no association whatsoever between the two. In one of the latest studies, scientists followed 657,461 children born from 1999 through 2013 in Denmark. This nationwide study revealed similar autism incidence between MMR-vaccinated and -unvaccinated children. This outcome was not influenced by autism-related risk factors or other childhood vaccinations.\n",
      "But the greatest offenses Wakefield committed were data manipulation and child abuse. \n",
      "Brian Deer, a British investigative journalist, exposed that the children’s accounts in the 1998 paper were inconsistent with medical reports and parent interviews (Figure 2). For instance, Wakefield et al. reported a range of 1–14 days in which autism occurred after MMR vaccination. But separate investigations revealed that some of the children had autism before vaccination, and some developed autism as late as 6 months after the MMR vaccine. Some children were not even diagnosed with autism.\n",
      "Deer further uncovered that Wakefield filed a patent for single vaccines against measle virus (rather than the MMR combination) in 1997, on the basis of a safer vaccine, which is only safer if the MMR vaccine is dangerous. Wakefield also received nearly half a million pounds from lawyers to support the case that vaccines cause autism. These are major financial conflicts of interest that Wakefield concealed.\n",
      "Aside from financial gains, Deer also found that Wakefield breached ethical issues by performing invasive procedures on the children, such as ileocolonoscopy, lumbar puncture, and MRI brain scan, without approval from the ethics committee. Some of the children were screaming and held down as the procedures were forced on them.\n",
      "\n",
      "It took 12 years for Wakefield et al.’s (1998) paper to be retracted. Many were disappointed at the painfully slow process. And the damage done along the way is massive and irreversible.\n",
      "MMR vaccine uptake declined right after the 1998 publication and remained so for years thereafter. To this day, MMR vaccine hesitancy remains undeterred, as evident in the 2017 Ipsos Mori Perils of Perception Survey, nearly 6 in 10 people across 38 countries were unsure or believed that vaccines cause autism (Figure 1). In 2021, a record high of nearly 40 million children were not fully vaccinated against the measles virus, partly due to pandemic disruptions and vaccine hesitancy.\n",
      "As a result, measles — being a highly contagious and potentially fatal virus — still kills more than 200,000 people annually, mostly children.\n",
      "Despite the widespread awareness that the 1998 paper of Wakefield et al. was fraudulent, autism-vaccine belief prevails for many reasons, one of which is that anti-vaccine theories kept evolving.\n",
      "Now Wakefield has ditched the leaky gut or opioid access theory for thimerosal (a mercury-based vaccine preservative) poisoning, alongside other questionable scientists. But multiple lines of research did not support any association between thimerosal and autism. Thimerosal contains ethylmercury that human tissues eliminate quickly, which can’t accumulate in the body like methylmercury found in fish and shellfish.\n",
      "Next, another type of vaccine adjuvant, aluminum, was blamed for causing autism, based on reports finding elevated aluminum levels in the brain of children with autism. As most children are vaccinated, the vaccine was assumed to be the source of the increased brain aluminum. But no credible evidence has substantiated this assumption. In fact, aluminum exposure from dietary sources (such as breast milk and formula) is about the same as all the vaccines an infant normally takes in the first year of life, and the total aluminum exposure is still far lesser than the toxicity limit.\n",
      "But the only plausible vaccine-autism link is arguably the Hannah Poling case in 2008. Hannah was 19 months old and healthy when she received five vaccines in one day due to prior delays. Two days after vaccination, she developed lethargy, irritability, and fever. She then faced developmental delays for the upcoming months and years and was diagnosed with autism and encephalopathy related to a pre-existing mitochondrial disorder.\n",
      "Her parents sued the government for compensation under the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program and won, which the anti-vaccine movement used as legal proof that vaccines cause autism.\n",
      "Hannah’s case was actually published as a case report in 2006, with her father, Jon S. Poling, MD, Ph.D., a neurologist, being the lead author. In this paper, Poling and other scientists argued that mitochondrial disorder compromised the cell’s energy levels. Coupled with excessive immune activation, be it from vaccination or infection, the resulting oxidative stress generated may overwhelm the cells. As the brain is highly metabolically active, it may be the first organ to be affected in this manner.\n",
      "Poling et al. ran further analyses in their paper. They compiled clinical data on 159 patients with autism and 94 patients of a similar age with other neurological disorders, and compared the patients’ biomarker profiles. Higher levels of aspartate aminotransferase in the autism group were noted (46% vs. 22% of patients). Creatine kinase levels were unusually high in the autism group too (47% of patients), but this data was lacking from the control group. This led to the conclusion that almost half of the autism cases also have underlying metabolic abnormalities.\n",
      "But other experts highly doubt Poling et al.’s arguments for many reasons:\n",
      "Overall, “…this was not a case of vaccines causing autism,” as Rahul K. Parikh, MD, Ph.D., associate professor of medicine, put it well. “Rather, this is a case where the court deemed it plausible that vaccines aggravated an underlying disease caused by bad mitochondria, and that some of the symptoms Hannah showed were similar to autism.”\n",
      "So, it seems plausible that vaccinations may play a role in Hannah’s developmental disorders: encephalopathy and autism-like features. But strict conditions must be met for a case like Hannah’s to occur. You need five vaccinations in a day and a pre-existing rare mitochondrial genetic disease. And even then, the vaccines may only be involved in aggravating the disease process, not causing the disease. Not to mention that it could have been infections that triggered Hannah’s developmental downfall, as her father admitted in his published case report of her daughter.\n",
      "“There is an incredibly small but real chance that a vaccine could aggravate an underlying mitochondrial disorder, which has been linked to regressive autism in a miniscule fraction of children,” Bobby Duffy, professor of Public Policy, said it well. “There are US court rulings [like Hannah’s case] that we could legitimately take as evidence of this being a hazard, but they are vanishingly rare, and the risk is therefore effectively non-existent. But that is a difficult point to communicate.”\n",
      "In the end, the vaccine-autism belief prevails to this day because people will always come up with reasons to blame the vaccine, even if the reasons are not scientifically sound. In an unfair situation when a precious child develops autism, it’s human nature to seek justifications for the misfortune. Yet, despite decades of research, the precise cause or trigger of autism remains unknown and may not exist given that autism is a multifactorial disorder. Vaccines are an attractive target to blame because a large community already shares the same sentiment — that big pharma will do anything for profit, including deception. But little did they realize that Wakefield and others are in it for the profit (and fame) too.\n",

Fudenberg, a former physician, titled “Dialysable lymphocyte extract (DLyE) in infantile onset autism: A pilot study,” where Fudenberg treated 40 cases of autism (20 true autistics and 20 pseudo-autistic syndromes). Most responded positively to transfer factor treatment. That was the main goal of the study. But Fudenberg also noted that 15 of the truly autistic children developed symptoms within a week after getting the MMR vaccine.\n",
      "The second was a 1996 brief report by professor Sudhir Gupta, MD, Ph.D., and colleagues, titled “Dysregulated Immune System in Children with Autism: Beneficial Effects of Intravenous Immune Globulin on Autistic Characteristics.” Herein, Gupta et al. treated 25 children with autism, finding some success with long-term immunoglobulin infusion. But Gupta et al. also noted high levels of maternal (mom’s) rubella antibodies in the children. They then subtly theorized that rubella antigens introduced via MMR vaccination could complex with pre-existing maternal antibodies to cause autism. \n",
      "(Vaccines like MMR introduce the pathogen’s antigen safely to train the immune system to produce antibodies that neutralize the antigen. So, when the actual pathogen infects, the antibodies are ready.)\n",
      "But Wakefield et al.’s (1998) paper was full of holes, with manipulation and misrepresentation of data, breaching of ethics and human rights, and unreliable sources cited (including the opioid excess theory and papers by Thompson et al., Fudenberg, and Gupta et al.). \n",
      "The crux of Wakefield et al. (1998) paper is that children with autistic also had intestinal abnormalities and developed autism within a week of MMR vaccination.

Wakefield also received nearly half a million pounds from lawyers to prove that vaccines cause autism. These are major financial conflicts of interest that Wakefield did not disclose.\n",
      "Aside from financial gains, Deer also found that Wakefield breached ethical issues by performing invasive procedures on the children, such as anesthesia, ileocolonoscopy, lumbar puncture, and MRI brain scan without approval from the ethics committee. Some of the children were screaming and held down as the procedures were forced on them. \n",
      "\n",
      "But even if no scientific misconduct was done, Wakefield et al.’s paper also fall apart in terms of scientific reasoning. \n",
      "The opioid excess theory of autism — which forms the crux of Wakefield’s vaccine-autism link — was discredited in later years. \n",
      "At least two studies from the U.K., in 2007 and 2008, found no differences in urinary opioid markers between children with and without autism. “These findings are counter to the putative mechanism of the leaky gut syndrome,” authors of the 2008 study wrote. “There is now a large body of work which refutes the theory and cannot replicate the findings.”\n",
      "As follows, a 2009 systematic review of 14 studies from the U.S. did not support the use of gluten-free or casein-free diets (GFCF) in treating autism. “The data from these studies do not support the Opioid-Excess Theory,” the review authors wrote. “Until conclusive evidence is found in support of GFCF diets, restrictive diets should only be implemented in the event a food allergy or intolerance is detected.”\n",
      "If the opioid excess theory of autism is invalid, the presumed mechanism of the MMR vaccine causing leaky gut and subsequent autism also becomes invalid. Now, the causative link between the MMR vaccine, inflamed and leaky gut, and autism falls apart. \n",
      "Moreover, Wakefield et al.’s 1998 paper was a case series of 12 children. A case series is just a compilation of case reports, which by themselves are weak evidence. By right, case series or reports serve to generate new hypotheses for further studies in larger cohorts. After the 1998 paper was published, Wakefield refused to conduct additional studies to support his findings, despite being aware of the allegations against his paper. \n",
      "What about Thompson et al.’s (1995), Fudenberg's (1996), and Gupta et al.’s (1996) papers that Wakefield et al. (1998) cited as support for the vaccine-autism link? Apparently, all of these sources are also unreliable. \n",
      "First, Thompson et al. reported higher rates of inflammatory bowel disease (but not coeliac disease or peptic ulceration) in children who received the live measle virus vaccine than unvaccinated children. But other imminent scientists at that time criticized that the unvaccinated children (controls) came from a different cohort, extracted from a child-health study conducted before measles vaccines were available. Recruitment and follow-up methods, as well as baseline characteristics, were also different between the two cohorts, rendering their comparison invalid.  \n",
      "Second, Fudenberg (1996) described that 15 out of 20 children with autistic developed their symptoms within a week after getting the MMR vaccine. But this paper suffers the same flaw as Wakefield et al.’s (1998), which only involves case series without further verification in larger cohort studies. Fudenberg doesn't seem to be a trustworthy scientist as well. The journal Biotherapy, in which Fudenberg published his paper, was discontinued in 1998 for fringe science. Fudenberg was also a co-inventor of the autism treatments that Wakefield patented in 1997. In fact, Fudenberg’s medical license was suspended in 1995 due to “dishonorable, unethical, or unprofessional conduct,” which failed to be reinstated in 2004. \n",
      "Third, Gupta et al.’s (1996) reported some success in using immunoglobulin infusion to treat children with autism, who also happened to have elevated maternal rubella antibodies. Gupta et al. then theorized that rubella antigens introduced via MMR (mumps, measles, and rubella) may interact with the pre-existing rubella antibodies to cause autism. But this was a mere hypothesis unrelated to the study findings and without plausible mechanisms of action. To this day, no data has substantiated Gupta et al.’s hypothesis. Currently, Gupta is a professor at the University of California and doesn’t seem to be involved in autism research any longer. \n",
      "Overall, not even a shred of scientific accuracy was present in the infamous 1998 paper of Wakefield et al., neither the clinical data nor sources cited. In the end, this paper was retracted in 2010, and Wakefield’s medical license was stripped by the British General Medical Council. \n",
      "Yes, it took 12 years, and the damage done along the way is massive and irreversible. MMR vaccine hesitancy and denial remain undeterred to this day. In 2021, nearly 40 million children were not fully vaccinated against the measles virus, a highly contagious and potentially fatal virus that still kills more than 200,000 people annually, mostly children. \n",

      "YouTube is to remove videos that spread misinformation about all vaccines, as it steps up a crackdown on harmful content posted during the coronavirus pandemic.\n",
      "From Wednesday, the video streaming site, which has already banned Covid jab falsehoods, will take down content that contains misinformation such as claiming any approved vaccine is dangerous, causes chronic health defects or does not reduce spread of disease.\n",
      "Under previous guidelines, the platform demoted – effectively hiding from view – videos that spread misinformation about non-Covid vaccines or promoted vaccine hesitancy.\n",
      "Last year, YouTube implemented a ban on Covid vaccine misinformation videos, which has led to 130,000 pieces of content being taken down since then. YouTube, which is owned by Google, has removed a total of 1m videos for spreading general Covid falsehoods since the pandemic broke out.\n",
      "Matt Halprin, the global head of trust and safety at YouTube, said vaccine misinformation was a global problem and had spilled over from the spreading of falsehoods about Covid jabs.\n",
      "“Vaccine misinformation appears globally, it appears in all countries and cultures,” he said.\n",
      "Halprin added that falsehoods around the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine, which has been wrongly attributed to causing autism, were an example of the misinformation YouTube will target.\n",
      "“There is still a lot of challenges around MMR and people arguing whether that causes autism. And as we know, the science is very stable that vaccines do not cause autism,” he said.\n",
      "Halprin said the ban would also apply, for instance, to content that claims vaccines cause cancer, infertility or contain microchips, the latter having gained prominence as a falsehood about Covid jabs.\n",
      "In 2019, a major study affirmed that there was no link between autism and MMR, in the wake of a pre-Covid upsurge in vaccine scepticism, fanned by social media and anti-government populism. A paper in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine, which is published by the American College of Physicians, found “no support for the hypothesis of increased risk for autism after MMR vaccination in a nationwide unselected population of Danish children”.\n",
      "Halprin said the new guidelines will still allow personal testimonies on taking vaccines, discussion of vaccine policies and references to historical failures in vaccine programmes, as long as the content does not include broad misinformation or promote vaccine hesitancy. As well as applying to falsehoods about vaccines for specific diseases such as hepatitis, the guidelines will apply to general statements about vaccines that are deemed to be misleading.\n",
      "On Wednesday, a search under the terms “MMR vaccine autism” produced a page of results containing rebuttals of any link between the vaccine and autism, including a video entitled “Vaccines and autism: how the myth started”. However, the page also includes a TV interview with the actor Robert De Niro in which he states that Vaxxed, a documentary directed by Andrew Wakefield – one of the key figures in promoting discredited links between MMR and autism – is a film that “people should see”. De Niro was being interviewed in 2016 after his Tribeca film festival pulled a screening of Vaxxed in the wake of a backlash against the film.\n",

      " It’s a grim and all too common sight for rangers at some of Africa’s nature reserves: the bullet-riddled carcass of an elephant, its tusks removed by poachers. African elephant populations have  fallen by about 30% since 2006  .  Poaching  has driven the decline. \n",
      " Some reserves, like Garamba in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Selous in Tanzania, have lost hundreds of elephants to poachers over the last decade. But others, like Etosha National Park in Namibia, have been targeted far less. What might explain this difference? \n",
      " That’s what we set out to explore in our  new paper  . We investigated why poaching rates vary so widely across Africa and what this might reveal about what drives, motivates and facilitates poaching. To do this, we used a statistical model to relate poaching levels from 64 African sites to various socio-economic factors. These included a country’s quality of governance and the level of human development in the area surrounding a park. \n",
      " Our findings suggest that poaching rates are lower where there is strong national governance and where local levels of human development – especially wealth and health – are relatively high. Strong site-level law enforcement and reduced global ivory prices also keep poaching levels down. \n",
      " Understanding these dynamics is crucial. The illegal wildlife trade is  one of the highest value illicit trade sectors globally  , worth several billion dollars each year. It poses a major threat to biodiversity and ecosystems, which are  the bedrock of human well-being  . And elephants are more than just a culturally significant icon. They are “  ecosystem engineers  ” that can boost forest carbon stocks and  diversify habitats  through their feeding. Their presence in national parks and reserves also has economic benefits, bringing in  valuable tourism revenues  . \n",
      " The  deaths of both poachers and rangers  in the continent’s violent biodiversity “war” also underscores our findings: when elephants lose, we all lose. \n",
      " We developed a statistical model using 19 years of data on 10,286 poached elephants at 64 sites in 30 African countries. These data were collected, mostly by wildlife rangers, as part of the global programme for  Monitoring the Illegal Killing of Elephants (MIKE)  , administered by the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). \n",
      " We then linked the poaching data to key socio-economic data related to areas around the parks, individual countries and global markets. \n",
      " Poaching of high-value species like elephants and rhinos is driven primarily by  sophisticated criminal syndicates  . So we used criminology theory and evidence from the scientific literature to generate hypotheses about factors that might drive, facilitate or motivate the decisions of these syndicates and the local hunters they recruited. We then identified datasets representing these factors, such as the  Uppsala Armed Conflict Dataset  and the Global Data Lab’s  Subnational Human Development index  . \n",
      " Read more:  Statistical models and ranger insights help identify patterns in elephant poaching \n",
      " Our tailored statistical model allows us to test for the effect of one hypothesised driver of poaching while accounting for the others. It also means we can look at local, national, regional and global factors together. \n",
      " Parks with higher levels of human development (based on health and wealth metrics from household surveys) and stronger law enforcement suffered less poaching. Poaching was also lower in countries where there was strong national governance quality. We measured this using the  World Bank’s governance indicators  . \n",
      " Socio-economic and political drivers were far more common than ecological ones. A park’s accessibility and size, the density of its vegetation and its elephant population did not affect its poaching levels. \n",
      " The strong associations we found between poaching and factors like corruption and human development do not necessarily imply that these factors directly cause poaching. Correlation does not imply causation. Deeper research at particular sites will reveal what underlying processes are at play, and offer a better understanding of cause and effect. \n",
      " But we do have some suggestions about what might lie behind the associations we found. These are rooted in  previous studies  . \n",
      " Why, for instance, would higher levels of local human well-being in an area be associated with lower poaching? \n",
      " One explanation could be that, in areas of economic deprivation and in the absence of alternatives, local residents might participate in poaching to meet their basic needs or earn extra income. \n",
      " Another interpretation might be that criminal ivory syndicates seeking to recruit local hunters target areas of lower human well-being because they can operate more effectively there. \n",
      " A number of biodiversity conservation actors, like government wildlife departments or environmental NGOs, have already recognised the value in focusing on improving human well-being around parks and reserves. A stellar example is  Namibia’s conservancy model  . It achieves effective conservation through local communities governing and benefiting from wildlife. \n",
      " Our study highlights that site-based conservation action alone cannot control illegal killing. A lot of what drives and facilitates elephant poaching is beyond conservationists’ remit or control. \n",
      " Conservationists can’t be expected to solve local human development issues or hold governments accountable on their own. Wider societal action to address poverty is required. This could include empowering women, increasing access to basic education, and promoting resilience to climate change. Such action is valuable in its own right, but will likely deliver benefits for elephants too. \n",
      " Finally, the positive relationship that we found between poaching and ivory prices suggests that tackling demand for illegal wildlife in end-markets is a key part of the puzzle. \n",
      " We suggest that tackling elephant poaching, and indeed the broader illegal wildlife trade, requires dealing with the wider systemic challenges of human development, corruption and consumer demand. It is not enough to just focus on actions traditionally defined as “wildlife conservation”. \n",

      " An apex predator has been quietly hunting interlopers in Death Valley, and for the first time, the deadly encounter has been captured on camera. \n",
      " A mountain lion can be seen via nighttime images pouncing onto the back of an in-stride wild donkey. \n",
      " The cougar easily wins the fight: A photograph taken seven minutes later shows it standing over the dead donkey, eyes glimmering as it stares into a wildlife camera. \n",
      " \"It's extremely rare to get a predation on camera,\" said Erick Lundgren, the biologist who captured the images. \"I guess that just goes to show that [this] predation is really not [that] rare in Death Valley.\" \n",
      " The newly documented cougar-donkey dynamic has been the focus of little research, but it might illustrate a developing relationship between the two animals that could benefit the ecosystem, according to  a recent study  . \n",
      " The feral donkeys, also known as burros, have long been  considered invasive and major disruptors  of native species and habitats in Death Valley,  pillaging wetlands and destroying vegetation  other animals rely on. But Lundgren is hoping this study could shift how conservationists and researchers view the donkeys. \n",
      " \"I was interested in the wild donkeys, not just as a pest ... but as wildlife,\" said Lundgren, the lead researcher of the report published in the  Journal of Animal Ecology  . \"Which is, I think, how you should study them if you want to understand them.\" \n",
      " Not only did the study find the donkeys were the \"primary recorded prey\" of mountain lions in certain areas of the national park but also that the presence of the big cats changed how and when the donkeys fed, roamed and congregated, and their interaction formed an \"emerging ecological network.\" \n",
      " The increased predation \"was associated with altered donkey activity patterns and rates, and with reduced herbivory and disturbance-related effects on desert wetlands,\" the study found. This limited damage from the donkeys in these areas. \n",
      " \"There's a prevailing narrative that wild horses and wild burros are problems ... at some kind of biological level,\" Lundgren said. \"And I think that's really non-scientific.\" \n",
      " However, in areas where the mountain lions were not as active, the study found donkeys continued to wreak havoc, the study found. \n",
      " Although the wild donkeys are not native to North America — they descended from the domesticated African wild ass, which was brought west by pioneers during the Gold Rush — Lundgren notes the region was home to different horse-like species before the last Ice Age that lived alongside prehistoric mountain lions more than 10,000 years ago. \n",
      " \"Mountain lions co-occurred with equids [horse-related species], just like wild donkeys, for several million years,\" he said. \"So it's kind of neat that they're together again and that these new relationships are unfolding, which in many ways mimic old relationships that were around for millions of years.\" \n",
      " For Mairin Balisi, a paleontologist and co-author of the study, the images of the mountain lion kill were the \"return of an extinct interaction.\" \n",
      " \"Fossil ecosystems are useful for providing baselines of conservation,\" said Balisi, a curator at the  Raymond M. Alf Museum of Paleontology  in Claremont. \n",
      " She said this evolving relationship in Death Valley has the potential to be a natural experiment in how the two species can benefit each other and the surrounding habitat. She likens the interaction to the  successful reintroduction  of the  gray wolf in Yellowstone National Park  , which had a positive effect on the food chain. \n",
      " But currently, Death Valley officials remain committed to their  zero burro goal  in the park, given how a consensus of prior research shows the animals \"  denude vegetation  at springs (sometimes completely), foul water with their excrement and prevent native wildlife, such as native bighorn sheep, from using springs,\" Death Valley spokesperson Abby Wines said. \n",
      " \"Mountain lion predation is not sufficient to control the burro population in the park,\" Wines said. \n",
      " There are an estimated 4,000 feral burros on parkland today, a drastic increase from about 400 in 2005, she said. National park leaders have worked  in recent years to  humanely remove the burros  from the park. \n",
      " Kate Schoenecker, a research wildlife biologist for the U.S. Geological Survey at Fort Collins Science Center who studies wild burros, said it's unlikely Death Valley will be able to eliminate the animals, given their  protected status  on nearby Bureau of Land Management and U.S. Forest Service land. \n",
      " She didn't question the park's efforts to remove the donkeys through trapping efforts, but said she was excited the new study gave a more in-depth look at the understudied burros. Specifically, she pointed out how the research documented the donkeys' \"predator-risk avoidance behavior,\" which  can positively affect ecosystems  . \n",
      " \"This is really cool because it's never been studied for burros,\" said Schoenecker, who noted the difficulty in drawing too many conclusions from the recent study given its small sample size and limited data. \n",
      " \"I think there's a lot we still don't know,\" Schoenecker said. \"We're just still learning about basic demographic rates of burros.\" \n",
      " Lundgren and Balisi agree there should be more research on the wild donkeys and their broader effects on the ecosystem. \n",
      " \"Ecologically important predator-prey interactions can emerge rapidly in novel ecosystems,\" Lundgren said, noting he is concerned that total removal of the burros could have unintended consequences for the larger food chain and how  continued threats to mountain lions  could stunt this potentially beneficial relationship. \n",

      "Across the African continent the populations of both species of African elephants – forest and savanna – have been declining due to habitat loss, poaching and human-wildlife conflict. \n",
      "Forest elephants are listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as “Critically Endangered” – a category for species that have declined over 80% within three generations. And it has listed savanna elephants as “Endangered” – indicating a decline of over 50% within three generations.\n",
      "But there remains some areas where there is both high quality habitat and stable elephant populations. These include Gabon, the northern Republic of Congo, northern Botswana, northern Tanzania and northern Kenya. \n",
      "Gabon holds roughly half of all forest elephants, which occur across almost the entire country’s area (about 250,000km2). It is the principal stronghold of a species that once numbered in the millions.\n",
      "Securing this stronghold is vitally important to the species’ future. Given the slow rate of forest elephant reproduction recruitment species recovery in more depleted areas will be slow.\n",
      "To ensure good decision-making for wildlife conservation, it’s important to know how many elephants there are. Researchers, practitioners and policy-makers all need data they can trust when designing new protected areas, managing existing ones, and creating national and international conservation laws and strategies.\n",
      "We set out to answer the question: How many forest elephants are in Gabon right now? \n",
      "Elephant surveys within Gabon since 2004 have covered just under a quarter of the nation’s elephant habitat, but over the last decade (since 2011) only 14% of the habitat has been surveyed. \n",
      "Thanks to a collaborative approach between the Wildlife Conservation Society, the Gabonese National Parks Agency and Vulcan Inc (a philanthropic foundation), we were able to plan and implement our nationwide, systematic population survey of forest elephants in Gabon using DNA from fresh elephant dung. \n",
      "This was the first national DNA-based assessment of any free-ranging large mammal in Africa.\n",
      "Our first aim was to collect as many dung samples as possible. We then assigned each dungpile to an individual elephant using DNA analysis. \n",
      "Our survey covered 18 plots, each at about 2,000km2 in size, which were spaced across the entire country. We looked for fresh elephant dung within each of sites, walking for about three weeks per site – a total of almost 8,300 km, a distance which is the equivalent of Canada to Gabon! \n",
      "We collected samples from just over 4,000 fresh dungpiles, which after DNA analysis, were found to have been deposited by almost 1,760 individuals (of which almost 70% were from females). \n",
      "Our results estimated that there are 95,110 forest elephants in Gabon. Our population estimation method depends on a proportion of individual elephants being “captured” more than once, a method formally known as spatially explicit capture-recapture. We also estimated that they lived at an average population density of 0.38 per km2, or roughly one elephant per square mile.\n",
      "Elephant densities were highest in relatively flat areas with a high proportion of reasonably intact lowland tropical forests. They were not found in high densities near the national border. \n",
      "Interestingly, human presence and activity did not appear to be strong predictors of elephant density. By contrast, elsewhere in Central Africa elephants avoid roads, villages, and populated areas. This is probably because Gabon has lower levels of elephant poaching than other countries. Gabon also has one of the lowest human population densities in Africa and over 90% of the population live in towns and cities. In the very lightly populated rural regions, there may be roughly one elephant for every twenty inhabitants. \n",
      "As key species in their ecosystem, forest elephants provide unique ecological services related to seed dispersal, trampling and nutrient cycling. This is why they are called “ecosystem engineers” and “mega-gardeners”. \n",
      "More recent work has shown the link between elephants and carbon sequestration. This is because tree species whose seeds are dispersed by elephants tend to be much larger, with higher wood density and higher carbon content than tree species dispersed by other methods, such as by monkeys or the wind.\n",
      "Unfortunately, despite their importance, there have been increasing reports of human-elephant conflict (crop-raiding) in some areas. This has become a highly charged political issue, as farmers blame their crop damage on elephant protection, which undermines conservation efforts. \n",
      "Since 2012 there have been studies in Gabon along the coast, a national review, and \n",
      "reports and investigations into appropriate methods for elephant conservation. \n",
      "Having acknowledged the updated forest elephant estimates provided in our study, the Gabonese government initiated a series of national meetings in December 2021. The aim was to outline a national strategy plan that addresses the concerns of the local communities affected by elephants.\n",
      "This is a welcome step forward. Our study provides a useful baseline with which to regularly monitor Gabon’s ambitious environmental and development policy goals.\n",
